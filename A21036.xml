            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">4. Piety.</note> Our meates should be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the condiments of sauoury discourse. Christs miracle, wrought at this feast, teaches so much: For miracles are seales of doctrine; and as he by this miracle made his disciples remember former doctrine; so thereby he tooke occasion (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) to teach the same doctrine to others. At the least by this miracle hee drew them on to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods mightie power, and to fall into good discourse about it. Now if Christ thought a feast a fit time to worke a miracle, surely we cannot thinke it vnfit to talke of Gods miracles, and the wonderfull things of his Law, and with <hi>Sampson, Iudges</hi> 14. to put forth heauenly Riddles, thereby iustling out vaine, and idle prattle. Banquets in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin are called <hi>Conuiuia,</hi> as one would say <hi>liuing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Beasts can feede together, but men should liue together as men; yea, as Christians, doing good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199:7"/> each to others soules. This the Apostle commands, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.18.19. Not so to fulfil our selues with wine, but that we may be fulfilled with the spirit, by the meanes of holy hymnes, and gracious conferences. But in many feasts, by the meanes of impure and adultrous songs, and speaches, the guests are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Diuell; and so sitting downe to eate, and to drinke, they rise vp to play, with those Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. Holy speach is vnsauory to many at meate, and all their cheere is marred with it: But it was Christs fashion thus to besprinckle the dishes in all the feasts hee was at, with this salt, as <hi>Luke</hi> 7. and <hi>Luke</hi> 14. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Vnder this last caution I comprehend two Rules to be obserued in feasting.<note place="margin">Where 2. Rules</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Rule.</hi> Christ must be inuited to the feast,<note place="margin">1. That Christ be spiritually feasted.</note> not corporally, as here, but spiritually. Now Christ cannot feede vpon thy meate; <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.<note place="margin">And that</note>
                     <hi>Will I eate the flesh of Buls?</hi> But he can feed vpon thy sobrietie, vpon thy good and holy speeches, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I ate mine hony-combe with mine hony, I dranke my wine with my milke.</hi> If Christ be inuited thou must not send him fasting from the table: See that thou prouide for the chiefe guest of all, whatsoeuer thou doest for the rest; now thou knowest what his fare is. Surely there is no feast, but eyther Christ or Sathan is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to it, and prouided for: But more is the pitty, Sathan is feasted oftner then Christ. Great ones, such whose fauour may stead vs much, are often and in great state feasted by vs; how much more should Christ our Iudge, to get his fauour against the day of hearing? But alas no feast now vnlesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199:8"/> Christ bee shut out as a marre-mirth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</note>Now Christ must be inuited, and be present at our Feasts in three regards.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As is already shewed, to be feasted with the exercise of grace,<note place="margin">1 With the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of grace.</note> in our Feasts.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">2 As the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour and moderator of the feast.</note>2. To be there as the gouernour of the Feast, that beholding him by faith, his presence may keepe vs in awe: And therefore in Scripture is that phrase of eating before the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. And <hi>Iude</hi> taxeth the Heretiques, that in the feasts of Christians, <hi>They fed themselues without feare, Iude</hi> 12. They fed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feare, namely of the great Master and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Feast, whose eye seene by faith, will driue away all reuels and ryot, all swearing, quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, healthing, and ribauldry from banquets.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Christ must be present at the feast,<note place="margin">3 As the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner of the feast.</note> as <hi>Caput coenae,</hi> as the daintiest dish, the seasoner and relisher of all the rest, as the onely ioy of the feast. Surely set Christ aside, and all feasting is but as the deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of rauenous <hi>Harpies:</hi> for Christ onely giues vs title to the creatures; and they onely can haue ioy in their meats that can eate them, as it were dipped in Christs bloud. <hi>Reioyce,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, in the Lord, Phil.</hi> 4. not in the table, but in the furnisher, not in the feast, but in the founder. An Epicure, like a bruite, tickles his senses with the pleasure of the meates, hee neuer reioyces in that God that <hi>fils his heart with food and gladnesse, Acts</hi> 14.17. that giues him both meate, and mouth, and stomacke to eate it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> As Christ must be feasted at our feasts, so must our Consciences<note place="margin">2. That the Conscience be feasted.</note> also: Neuer feast so as that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199:8"/> thou dash that continuall feast of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As good reason in our feasts Christ our Iudge should be remembred; so likewise Conscience our Witnesse: If both these be feasted, both will be with vs. Drunkennesse and Gluttony in feasting, sad and make heauy the Conscience, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. And thus many make the day of their feasts, to be a fasting-day to the soule, not affording it the least morsell to refresh it, but grieuously wounding and wasting it: Of such it may be said, as the holy Ghost of the Israelites, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.15. though in another sence, that in their eating, <hi>leannesse enters into their soules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Christs example Ministers<note place="margin">Ministers may be at feasts.</note> may learne, that it <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> is not vnfit for them to be present with their friends at feasts: Ministers should be affable and sociable, and not of that austeritie which makes men vnfit to be conuersed with, as it makes wine vnfit to be drunken. Yea, how euer antient Canons haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Ministers presence at Marriages, yet there is great vse of it, namely, that their presence may keepe men in compasse. Therefore God vnder the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.29. tooke order that the Leuite should be at the feasts. <hi>The eyes of the King in the throne chase away euill;</hi> so doth the grauity of godly Ministers eyes, and the graciousnesse of their speech keepe out euill in feasts: as no doubt but Christs presence here did.

Among the ancients in Banquets oyntments were in vse, as wee see in the woman breaking the Boxe of oyntment on our Sauiours

                     <hi>Iesus said vnto her; Woman, what haue I to doe with thee? Mine houre is not yet come.</hi>

                  <p>It containes a refusall of her request, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Where we may consider, 1. The Manner of his refusall, not without some seeming sharpnesse, in the title hee giues her, <hi>Woman,</hi> not <hi>Mother;</hi> and in the manner of his speech, <hi>What haue I to doe? &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Reasons of his refusall: First, it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not belonging to her; Christ was not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, or put in minde by any, to doe the things belonging to his calling: <hi>What haue I to doe with thee? q.d.</hi> What hast thou to doe with me? Thou art too busie to interpose thy selfe, I know what is to be done without thee: So <hi>Dauid</hi> vses the like speech, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. <hi>What haue I to doe with you, yee sonnes of Zeruiah?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Mine houre is not yet come;</hi> namely, to helpe this want of wine by miracle: Thou art too hasty.</p>
                  <p>By this then it may appeare, that there was an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199:10"/> errour in <hi>Maries</hi> speech to Christ:<note place="margin">Hovv the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin fayled in her spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ch to Christ.</note> which what it was wee may perceiue by these words of Christ. First, in the word <hi>Woman,</hi> seemes to be implyed, that she presumed vpon her being Christs mother, and thought by priuiledge thereof to haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned helpe at his hands. And therefore Christ not acknowledging her in this case for his mother, cals her <hi>woman.</hi> Secondly, she presumed too farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her bounds, to put Christ in minde of doing that that appertained to his function, as was the working of the Miracle: So much the words, <hi>What haue I to doe with thee?</hi> doe import. As if he should say; Can I not doe it without your intermedling? The word <hi>Woman</hi> also, seemes to import so much, as if he should say; Thou art but a <hi>woman,</hi> and it is not for women to intermeddle and to interpose themselues in these affayres. Thirdly, it seemes that shee in her petition onely respected the credit of the Bridegroome, that he might not be shamed in this want of wine, if generall notice were taken of it: Whereas Miracles haue an higher end, and respect the truth of God, that it might be sealed by this meanes vnto the hearts of Gods elect: but <hi>Mary</hi> at this present regarded not this; <hi>They haue no wine,</hi> saith shee. Her care was all for that: shee saith not; They haue no faith. Her desire was for a supply of wine for their mouthes, not of faith for their hearts. Fourthly, shee made too much haste, shee would haue the miracle wrought in all the haste, presently, before the matter were knowne of the guests. This is implyed, in these words; <hi>Mine houre is not yet come.</hi> Were it not for these errours,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199:11"/> it might seeme strange, that Christ that yeelded miracles so easily to so many vpon their requests, as blinde, and lame, &amp;c. should yet sticke thus with his Mother, who neuer flatly denyed any, saue the tempting Diuell, and curious <hi>Herod.</hi>

Surely here eyther shee or Christ must needes sinne: shee in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her requesting Christ to worke a miracle; or else Christ in reprehending her: But this latter is blasphemous, therefore the former is true. It is a seely shift, that this reprehension was for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others; So indeede ought all publique reprehension to be: Doth it not therefore argue a fault in the reprehended? Neyther is it euident that Christ spake this aloud to <hi>Mary:</hi> But as <hi>Mary</hi> going about the house ministring, came and spake as it were in her Sonnes eare: for as her desire was to saue the credit of the Bridegroome; so it is not vnlikely that Christ answered her on the same manner. 2. Alike true is that which they teach, concerning that preuayling power which she now hath in heauen: Will shee be endured comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in heauen, that would not be endured entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on earth? Christ humbled on earth, would not acknowledge her for his Mother in matters pertayning to his office, but rancked her amongst ordinary women; how much lesse then will he doe it now glorified in heauen?

Indeede great is the duty wee owe to our Parents; neyther, as <hi>Austen</hi> sayes, did Christ come to this marriage to teach Children to despise their Parents: for hee did this as God, and not simply as man; in which nature onely hee was subiect to his mother. That which hee had receiued of his Mother could not worke a Miracle, namely, his Man-hood, but onely his God-head, the glory whereof would haue beene obscured, if at her appoyntment the Miracle had beene wrought, specially so vnseasonably, before the fit time was come.

And hereto reason might lead her; for to haue caused wine on the sodaine to haue set it selfe, without hands, on the table, or to be brought in by strangers, would but haue obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the glory of the Miracle, and haue seemed

                  <p>Here some Questions may be moued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. What was this <hi>Gouernour of the feast?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the feast was.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Some hold him onely as a steward or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, to looke onely to the meates‚ñ™ But I thinke rather that hee was as well to looke to the guests, and to the order they kept; as the <hi>Modiperator</hi> and <hi>Symposiarcha</hi> among the <hi>Romanes:</hi> Such happily were those officers, <hi>Esth.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Baronius</hi> out of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi> shewes, that this gouernour among the Iewes was a Priest: Such was their care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good order in their feasts, which otherwise would haue beene full of prophanesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Why did Christ bid them carry to this Gouernour?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, according to the custome: for the Gouernour did first taste, and then giue to others: Secondly, his taste was fitter to iudge, because fasting: Thirdly, to make way for the declaration
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199:16"/> of the Miracle, because hee was ignorant of the matter.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the <hi>Preparation</hi> to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
                  <p>The third Point followes, <hi>The Miracle it selfe,</hi> of turning the <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine:</hi> where diuers things may be demanded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. When was the water turned into wine?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Some thinke before it was carryed to the Gouernour, in the very act of the seruants draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Others thinke, after it was drawne and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Gouernour.</p>
                  <p>Reasons for the former opinion are these:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not onely one pot-full was turned, which was carryed to the Gouernour, but all the sixe ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were turned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because it is said that the <hi>Gouernour knew not whence the wine was, but the seruants did.</hi> But neyther of these arguments are of force: for to the first I answere; That all the water in the vessels was turned into wine at that instant that the water drawne in the pot carryed to the Gouernour was turned. To the second; That the seruants draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water for the Gouernour in an empty vessell, might well enough know, that if there were any wine, it must come out of the water-pots, by the conuersion of that water they had drawne into wine. But I confesse there is a further difficulty in this argument: for the seruants might know whence wine was in the cup, after the discouery of the Gouernour, though it were water when
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199:16"/> they drew it; but before he had spoken something, they could not know that there was wine in the vessell deliuered, had it not beene wine when they drew it.</p>
                  <p>Reasons for the other opinion are: first, the words of the Text; <hi>The seruants that drew the water knew it:</hi> Secondly, if turned before, their astonishment would haue beene such, that they could not but presently haue spoken it to all the table: Thirdly, it commends the obedience of the seruants the more, that as before they powred water into the vessels, so now at Christs command they carry pure water to the Gouernour of the feast, not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his offence. But I leaue it free to chuse eyther of the opinions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. How was it changed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In an instant, as our bodies shall be at the last day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. for this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt miraculous and naturall workes. Naturall workes are done slowly, and successiuely in space of time: the other are done in an instant. Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians heale men in long tract of time, faire and softly; Christ gaue them whom hee healed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health at once. There is one onely example contrary to this distinction of naturall and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous workes; namely, the miraculous restitution of the blinde man, <hi>Marke</hi> 8. vnto his sight by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: first, to see men as trees, &amp;c. And it was for speciall end, to shew both the greatnesse of our spirituall blindnesse, healed but by little and little, by degrees, and the greatnes of his grace that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery particular increase of spiritual light in vs.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:199:17"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. What kinde of Wine was this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It appeares by the speech of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Verse</hi> 10. whose taste wee may trust, that it was passing good: As generally the miracles of Christ were most exact and perfect, and far aboue the workes of Nature. No naturall wine compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this: and so no eyes so cleare, no hands, legges, or other members, so strong and comely, as those which Christ restored. Nature his seruitor may bungle sometimes, but hee the Lord of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth all in print. Christs Miracles were new Creations, and therefore wee may well looke that there should be the same commendation of <hi>very good,</hi> which was at the first Creation. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. Why did Christ make this wine so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing good?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> To set his marke as it were vpon it, and to prouoke all the tasters to a deeper admiration of his glory. Such is our stupiditie, wee are ready to passe by Gods worthy workes; therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this, hee imprints some notable remarkeable qualitie in them, that may make them for euer to be remembred As in his Wine, that is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, there is a speciall goodnesse and delicacie that may make our teeth to water; so in his Vinegar, that is his iudgements, there is a speciall tartnesse and sowrenesse, that may set our teeth on edge. In the good wine, for the godly, a speciall relish, in the ill, for the wicked, a speciall tang, that it may easily appeare whose finger had the tempering of the cup.</p>
                  <p>This our owne experience will testifie: In the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199:17"/> Gunpowder-treason-traytors, some of them were hurt with powder themselues: those of the league in <hi>France,</hi> drew their swords afterwards one against another. And so strange was the iudgement against <hi>Caine,</hi> that God was said to set a marke vpon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. So in mercies to his Church and children, they haue had some speciall quality to commend them to the enioyers: As preferring them then when they haue beene despised and vniustly dealt with, as <hi>Dauid</hi> to the kingdome, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. Why did Christ worke this Miracle at this time, and what aymed heat?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Besides inferiour ends already touched, and other mayner ends noted afterwards, Christ might seeme in this miracle to ayme at these things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To shew his goodnesse and mercy:<note place="margin">Sixe ends of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>sts tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine.</note> And this was common generally to all his miracles, that they were not like <hi>Moses</hi> his, of iudgement and destruction, but of succour and reliefe. Hee once with his curse withered the Figge-tree, but therein hee shewed mercy, that hee did not chuse any man
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199:18"/> to giue vs a proofe of his Iustice, as full oft he did to shew his Mercy, but a Plant. Another time he draue his enemies backward, but yet he gaue them strength to recouer, and come againe towards him. This difference of <hi>Christs</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, implyes a difference that is betweene the Law and the Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To shew his Lordship and absolute power ouerall creatures; and therefore almost no kinde of creature which he wrought not miracles vpon. As vpon men, their eyes, hands, feete, whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yea, their wils and affections; as causing the owner of the Asse to be willing to let him goe to strangers demanding him: vpon Angels, in the eiection and dispossession of Diuels: vpon b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>asts, both vpon the earth, making the foale of an Asse, though vnbroken, to carry him; and in the sea, as in the fish, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. vpon the heauens, in the Sunnes eclipse at his death: vpon the ayre, in the windes stilled: vpon the waters, in the sea calmed: vpon the earth, in her quaking: on her stones, in their rending: on her fruits, in the Figge-tree, and in the multiplication of the loaues, and here in the Wine. As therefore in the multiplication of the loaues, he shewed that it was hee that euery yeare caused the corne to multiply in the earth, euen of one corne an hundred sometimes; so here, that it is hee that doth turne the water in the Vine into Wine, and so ouerthrowes both the <hi>Bacchus</hi> and the <hi>Ceres</hi> of the Heathen. Hee is the true God of Wine, and of Bread, and of all the rest of the Creatures.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:199:18"/>
                  <p n="3">3. As in healing of bodily diseases his intent was, to declare himselfe the soules Physitian; and in feeding them with the loaues, to be the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of their soules, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. So here, in giuing them Wine, to worke naturall gladnesse, to shew himselfe the reuiuer and comforter of their soules, with the spirituall wine of the Promises, of peace of Conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost. Thus in some sort this wine might be of the same vse to them, which the Wine in the Sacrament is to vs; and indeede to some it was, <hi>verse</hi> 11. to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Disciples: otherwise, it was not the gracing of the feast, nor the prouiding for the guests appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites that hee respected. In this sence wee may say as the Apostle saith; <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> so, doth Christ take care for mens bellies and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites? To this meditation, by this miracle, hee prouoked them; and so wrought this Miracle, as <hi>Sampson</hi> put forth his Riddle, to draw away their mindes from idle matters, and to imploy them in the consideration of his glorious power.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To teach vs that hee is the Author of all earthly benefits and comforts: All which hauing lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> wee cannot recouer but in him. <hi>The wine,</hi> and all other creatures faile vs, but in, and by Christ, wee haue right to them, and they serue vs as their lawfull Lords, and not as they doe the wicked, as vsurping tyrants.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To shew that hee both can and will turne his Childrens <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine,</hi> gall into hony, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sorrow into sweetnesse of ioy. To the wicked that are out of Christ, their very <hi>Wine</hi> is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199:19"/>
                     <hi>Water,</hi> and their daintiest drinke is bitter, <hi>Is.</hi> 24.9. <hi>They shall not drinke wine with mirth, strong drinke shall be bitter to them that drinke it.</hi> But to the godly contrarily, as a little for quantitie is much, <hi>Ps.</hi> 37. so for qualitie, that which is weak &amp; poore is made strong and hearty, as in <hi>Daniels</hi> pulse, and the hard fare of many of the godly. Thus was browne bread and water turned into manchet and wine, to the Martyres in prison: And no maruell, when the Prisons themselues were turned into Paradises, and the fires wherein they were burnt, into beds of Roses, as some of them professed. And as thus hee can sweeten all our afflictions, so those that are in marryed estate, which it seemes, this miracle, wrought at a marriage, might haue some refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To shew, that as the Wine was not made of Water, till all their owne wine fayled; so must we not expect Christs wine, his spirituall Comforts, as long as we giue our selues to carnall and earthly ones: As long as <hi>Aegypt</hi> flowre lasts, <hi>Manna</hi> is not rayned.</p>

                     <hi>Now when the Gouernour of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine (for hee knew not whence it was: but the seruants which drew the water, knew,) the Gouernour of the feast called the Bridegroome,</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>Notification</hi> of it was in this manner, and by these meanes: First, the Gouernour of the feast his ignorance whence that wine was, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants knowledge: Secondly, the effects both of his ignorance and their knowledge; of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, calling of the Bridegroome and expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him for detaining the best wine till now; of the Seruants knowledge, that vpon the hearing of these words vttered by the Gouernour, and knowing with themselues what they brought, <hi>to wit, Water,</hi> being astonied, they declare vnto them, that they filled water, and brought nothing but water out of the water-pots: whereupon, as it is further probable, the guests for their better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, rising to see the water-pots, saw them all full of wine.

This ignorance of the Gouernour might seeme a meere casuall thing: for hee being to looke to things, neuer stood still, but one while was in one place, another while in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,

But by this wee see how Gods prouidence did thus dispose of it purposely. This must teach vs patiently to beare all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, and to be content if it seeme good to God to detaine the knowledge of some things from vs, reuealed vnto others.

                  <p>The meaning is not, that it was the first of those miracles hee wrought in <hi>Cana,</hi> but simply it was the first: As for the miracles he should worke du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his childe-hood, they are idle fopperies: The end of miracles is to seale doctrine; but then hee taught not, and therefore wrought no miracles.

                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Why Christ prayed at the raising of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> rather then in other miracles.</note>1. <hi>He shewed thereby his owne glory, verse</hi> 11. He shewed his glory, that is, his God-head: for others though they wrought miracles, yet they did it by his power, and therefore called vpon him for help: as wee see in the Apostles. Christ wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by his owne power, and therefore vsually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not vpon God in his Miracles, vnlesse in the raising of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and there hee did it for speciall reason: First, by way of figure, to shew how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly sinners that haue lyen long in the graue of sinne, are raised vp to newnesse of life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no such adoe in the raising of the maide, and the young man not buryed. Secondly, hee did it for examples sake, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.42. <hi>I know that thou hearest mee alwayes, but because of the people that stand by, I said it, that they may beleeue that thou hast sent mee.</hi> And these prayers are actions of Christ in regard of his man-hood, which is but the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the God-head, in working the Miracle, and which may therefore desire the liuely declaration of the God-heads presence. As for his prayer in the miracle of the multiplication of the loaues, it was for the blessing of God vpon that they should eate, not for the multiplication. And if in some miracles hee called vpon God, it was to shew that as Mediator hee was inferiour to the Father; as in other and greater miracles hee did not call on him, to shew that as hee was God, hee was equall with him. And therefore hence, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. vertue is said to haue gone out of Christ, in working of miracles.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199:22"/> Further, by the doctrine which Christ taught, and confirmed with miracles, it appeared, that by his miracles hee shewed himselfe to be God: for if he had lyed, in saying hee was God, such miracles as none but God can worke, should not haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his doctrine, but haue confuted it rather, in the ouerthrow of his person.</p>

But now the <hi>manner</hi> is all, and so they are lesse then Christs; for first, they did it not in their owne names; and secondly, they did not, as Christ, preach any such doctrine, that they were Gods.</p>

                  <p>This which Christ makes the end of his miracle, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:199:23"/> God should deny himselfe, if hee should not in all things seeke his owne glory: But wee are poore creatures, depending vpon God, and because wee are of him, therefore also for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and for him are all things.</hi> As in a circle, where the beginning was, there is the end; so God who is our <hi>Alpha,</hi> must be our <hi>Omega</hi> to.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Because their speciall vse was at the first, when the new, and neuer heard-of mysterie of the Gospell was preached to the world, wholy auerse from it, to prouoke their attention, and make them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199:23"/> willing to giue eare to that doctrine that had such strange attendants: Otherwise they would neuer haue heeded it. The principall vse of Miracles was for vnbeleeuers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Strange tongues are for a signe, not to them that beleeue, but to them that beleeue not:</hi> But now the Gospell being planted, and generally beleeued, there is no such vse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, these seales of Miracles which God set to the Gospell at first, still remaine in their print. Wee haue the vse of the first miracles: and it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to beleeue without miracles, as it is to swimme without bladders, or to goe without crutches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. These Disciples are said to beleeue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how then are they said to beleeue?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, because their faith was lifted vp to an higher degree, so that in comparison their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faith was no faith: Secondly, in regard of a fresh and new act of their faith. Their small faith they had before, being as it were a sleepe, was awakened and quickned by this Miracle. As a man that hauing gone stands still, when he goes againe may be said to beginne to goe. Where we learne:</p>
                  <p>That where true grace is, there is a proceeding;<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> True grace hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> though it be but weake, and can scarse creepe, yet when God puts vnder it his stilts, his crutches, it will take the aduantage of them, and will be going: Examine we therfore our faith by this; If it be more liuely, after more liuely and effectuall meanes, as here this their faith after the Miracle. As wee see how after some plentifull showre the grasse sprouts forth lustily, that before was very short. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>These things haue I written to you that beleeue, that ye
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:199:24"/> may beleeue,</hi> namely, more strongly: So here did Christ worke this Miracle before his beleeuing Disciples, that they might beleeue. So should it be with Christians, after a good Sermon, after some speciall worke of Gods mercy or iustice, to gather strength. A poore horse that goes slowly, yet when well baited and refreshed, will goe fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then we say, Now he goes, as if he went not before: So a dead fire, when quickned with the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, will cast forth a greater hear, &amp; then we say, Now it burnes, and yet it burnt before. A christian must not be discouraged if he finde some dulnes, &amp; deadnes, &amp; weaknes in his faith, so be it when God comes with his baite, with his bellowes, with his showres, he feele spirit &amp; quickning. But then is the discouragement, when our faith sleeping, cannot be awakened with those blessed means God vseth.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>manner</hi> is, first with violence, and with force, in whipping them out, and in throwing downe their tables: secondly, with authoritie and power, in making them yeeld both to his whip, to his words, and commands.</p>
                  <p>For the first, two things may be asked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whom hee whipt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Both the men, &amp; the beasts: Some thinke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beasts, not the men. Their reasons are; First, The words may be so read, <hi>He draue them out, both sheepe and oxen:</hi> But I answere, the words may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be read otherwise, <hi>And the sheepe and oxen:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                     </gap>, the masculine gender, doth not so well agree with <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> the Neuter. The second Reason: Hee speakes to the Doue-sellers to carry away their Doues, so it is likely that hee spake to the sellers of Oxen. <hi>Ans.</hi> Very likely so: But it followes not, because hee spake, therefore hee whipt them not, in whipping speaking, seasoning his correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with instructions. The third Reason: It makes more to the commendation of the Miracle, that his very words, without blowes, should driue them out. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Miracle is as great, that not onely
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:199:26"/> they are made to endure imperious words, but as they might take it, contumelious blowes also, which are more hardly digested by free men, specially with a whip, that belongs to a dogge. And surely the men deserued the whip more then the beasts. The poore innocent beasts, what could they doe? It was the men that brought them thither: But this shewes Gods hatred against sinne, which is not onely against the authour of sinne, but against the matter and instrument, yea the senslesse instrument abused to sinne; As in his curse vpon the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. A good meditation when Gods wrath is against our beasts, our money, or ought else, which hath beene sinnefully abused by vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Why whipped hee, and so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threw downe their wares? For it may seeme strange, that so peaceable and louing a Sauiour, on whom the Doue ere while descended, as though he had no gall, that he, that according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie should not cry, nor lift vp his voyce, in his first entrance into the Temple, should deale thus boysterously.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ did this for many weighty reasons:<note place="margin">7. Reasons of Christs vvhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them out of the Temple.</note> And this scourge of Christ is like <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that budded, yeelding vs many a good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To shew that Christ is not an hony God,<note place="margin">Christ is not a God all of mercie.</note> made all of mercy without iustice, as the world supposes, but hee hath his <hi>rod to come with,</hi> as well as the <hi>spirit of meeknesse:</hi> and he is a Lyon as well as a Lambe, and an Eagle, as well as a Doue. Know thou therefore, and learne so much from this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199:27"/> whip, that Christ hath a whip, and whipping-cheare for all refractary sinners, abusing mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">Meeknesse is not sheepish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>2. Christ would hereby teach vs, that the Doues meekenesse must not make vs Asse-like patient, or sheepishly simple and fearefull: But though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of want of gall thou shouldest be a Doue, yet in regard of spirit, and boldnesse, and zeale for God, a very Lyon, not fearing the faces of the wicked, though neuer so many, but with much courage and confidence to confront them, and to shew thy zeale against sinne by taking punishment of it, as thy place giues leaue. This was the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> zeale against the incestuous person, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Behold, what zeale, what reuenge:</hi> And this was <hi>Moses</hi> his zeale against the Israelites, for the golden Calfe. Excellently <hi>Salomon, Pro.</hi> 28.4.<note place="margin">Prou. 28.4. inlightened.</note>
                     <hi>They that forsake the Law, prayse the wicked:</hi> Yea, but might some say, I prayse them not, I would things were otherwise, I dislike these and these courses, therefore I hope I am well. Nay, sayes <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the next words, <hi>They that keepe the Law, set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against them.</hi> Not enough for thee to dislike their doings in iudgement, but thou must oppose them, and shew zeale, as here Christ did, by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them in thy place. Many faintly and coldly shew their dislike against wicked men, as <hi>Eli</hi> against his wicked sonnes: But it is, to vse <hi>Sophocles</hi> his comparison, as if in a festred wound or sore, the Chirurgion should onely blow vpon it with his mouth, whereas there must be cutting, lancing, searching, burning, and the greatest violence that can be.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:199:27"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ thus beginning his office of preaching the Gospell,<note place="margin">Reformation of corruptions makes vvay for preaching the Gospell.</note> with so zealous a purging of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, teacheth, that this must be the first worke, to reforme abuses, and throughly and effectually to purge out corruptions, before the truth be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Otherwise corruptions retained with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, will be to it, as Iuie to the Oake, as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as thornes to the seede. So in the health of the body, the first thing is to euacuate ill humours, which otherwise will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt all the good nourishment that is receiued. Miserable experience in many Churches hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified this, how but a little corruption tolerated at first, hath been as leauen to sowre the whole batch of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To teach that men are so set to maintaine their gainfull corruptions in the Church, as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his Temples of <hi>Diana,</hi> that no hope of a reformation by a vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>untary relinquishing of them. Vnlesse God come with a strong hand, they will hold their corruptions, as fast as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. <hi>It must be the whip of Christ that must purge the Temple:</hi> So <hi>Grostead</hi> that renowned Bishop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied, that the reformation of the Church could not be, but <hi>in ore gladij cruentandi:</hi> And experience verified this in the beginning of the reformation by <hi>K. Henry</hi> 8. in the violent ouerthrow of the Abbeyes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ being afterward to be whipped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so his Apostles, by the Iewes, and other of his seruants by other of his enemies, doth first begin to whip them, and that out of the Temple,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199:28"/> as Lord of the Temple; thereby declaring his Kingly soueraigntie in the Church, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his Church: That howsoeuer sometimes he may seeme, to let the <hi>whip</hi> goe out of his owne hand into his enemies, to afflict his owne, and Churches backe, yet when hee will, hee can take the whip into his hands, and scourge out those that trouble and defile his Church. This is our comfort, when <hi>Money-changers in the Temple,</hi> and <hi>Sheepe-sellers,</hi> filling the Temple with their trash and trumpery, and whipping out of the Temple the true worshippers of Christ, that being annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pestered with this filth, wee may goe to Christ, as the Lord of his Temple, and desire him to take the possession of it, to take the whip into his owne hands, and to chase out these creatures with their cattell.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <note place="margin">The base ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Christ makes of maintainers of corruption.</note>6. Christ by putting these corrupters of his Temple to the ignominie of the whip, whipping them out, like beastly curres, doth further shew, how basely hee doth account of all such wretches, that for their owne backe and bellies sake, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine corruptions in the Church. Such men are like those base creatures that liue vpon corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and excrements, and putrifaction, as Rats, Mice, &amp;c. So doe these liue vpon the filth and corrupt excrements of the Temple. Though flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in outward wealth, they may thinke well of themselues, yet with God they are very dogges, and so hee vses them. Like as a Gentleman, will scorne to fight with his sword with a base vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hauing abused him, but will take a cudgell
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:199:28"/> and thwacke him with it: So <hi>Is.</hi> 9.15. <hi>The false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is as the tayle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Christ hereby shewes, that in desperate and desolate times, when no helpe can be expected for his Church from ordinary gouernours, hee will yet graciously visit his Church, and raise vp some select choyse instruments or other, induing them with extraordinary and heroicall zeale and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for the reformation of the Church. The Priests were generally corrupt, and how should reformation proceede from the authors of abuses? how should <hi>deformers</hi> be <hi>reformers?</hi> yet now Christ comes with his whip. In the like corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion in this latter age, God raysed vp that heroicall worthy, <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and many worthy Princes, with their whips to driue the Masse-mongers out of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the violence vsed.</p>
                  <p>The second point in the <hi>manner</hi> of this action of Christ, is the power and authoritie, which is miraculously strange; insomuch as <hi>Origen</hi> makes this a greater miracle then the other of turning <hi>water</hi> into <hi>wine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The greatnesse of this miracle.</note> where onely the senslesse creature yeelded, but here the spirits of many hundred men are tamed: And <hi>Hierome</hi> makes it the greatest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that euer Christ did, that a poore stranger, in shew but contemptible, should with the stroakes of so little a whip, master so great a multitude: So that though they were sturdy fellowes, and it was their gaine and liuelihood that Christ went about to depayre them of; yet Christ no sooner speakes and shakes his whip, but like a company of feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199:29"/> Hares and Buckes, they all runne away. In the maintenance of their trades, though neuer so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, how full of stomacke men are, <hi>Demetrius</hi> his example shewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. And the Prouerbe is, that, <hi>The belly hath no eares:</hi> But yet if Christ speake to the belly, as here hee doth to many greedy bellies, hee will make it finde eares and feete to. And the Miracle was also the greater in regard of the time, that it was now against the Passeouer, which was their great Mart, there being then such a generall recourse of the whole Nation to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who all were to be their chapmen. No doubt, but as <hi>Hierome</hi> notes, there was a speciall Maiestie, and awfull grace in the very eye of Christ, that daunted them and confounded them, as wisdome makes the faces euen of poore Christians to shine, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Igneum &amp; sidereum quid ex eius oculis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diebat.</hi> As sometime in Christs eye there was a speciall alluring grace, that drew men towards him, as in the calling of many Disciples, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first word followed him, and in <hi>Peters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, caused by the gracious aspect and cast of his eye: so sometimes againe, a speciall astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing glory, as here, and <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. in driuing back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his enemies.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By this Christ would teach vs, how in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <label type="milestone">

Here were Priests, Scribes, Pharises, all allowers of these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, a company of greedy Cormorants that liued altogether by these corruptions, yet not one of these dares quitch, not an hand lift vp; feete running apace and obeying, not one hand resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This might be seene of late yeares, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this happy Reformation here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Good Lord, who would haue thought it possible that Popish Shauelings, so setled and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that had such power and authoritie, and wealth withall, could euer haue beene so easily remoued! Yet at the presence of Christ and his whip, how sodainely vanished they and all their baggage! Though as hils and mountaines, yet they skipped as Lambs and Rammes, and at the word of Christ were flung into the Sea. This must comfort the Church euer in all vnlikelihoods of reformation: what though there stand neuer such mountaines in the way? they shall all be turned into plaines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods <hi>Zerobabels.</hi> What though the Money-changers haue gotten the possession of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and erect their chayres, and play reakes there? yet Christs whip will come and take downe their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199:30"/> pride, and thrust them out of the Temple, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> for all their craking and vsurping, out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family with bagge and bottle.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> Christ speaking to them with such authoritie, whilest hee whipt them with such seueritie,<note place="margin">Christs rods are speaking, as well as smiting rods.</note> wee may see that his corrections are not mute, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is mingled to sanctifie the correction, by shewing them the cause of their corrections: And though Christ doe not now speake to vs with an audible voyce, in his corrections, yet secretly hee doth in the checke and cry of our Conscience: As in <hi>Iaakob, Gen.</hi> 35.1. in his present afflictions in the fore-going Chapter hee admonished him of the disorders of his familie. Wee must not onely minde the rod, but the voyce of it, and of God in it; <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Heare the rod:</hi> And then, <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastisest and teachest in thy Law, Ps.</hi> 94.12.</p>
                  <p>The second poynt in the <hi>Action,</hi> is the <hi>Cause,</hi> why Christ dealt thus roughly with these men: For by reason of the farre distance of many from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it was permitted them by Gods Law, to sell their beasts at home, and to buy others, and therefore the sellers of Sheepe and Oxen might seeme to doe a good worke, to prouide the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in a readinesse; and whereas there might be diuers occasions for exchange, as of gold for siluer, greater for smaller, strange coyne for the money of that place (for some of the Iewes were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into forreyne parts) to helpe this there were Money-changers. And what hurt is there in all this?</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:199:30"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> All the hurt was, that all these things were done within the Temple, a place of that holinesse, that a vessell might not be carryed through it; in which regard afterward hee charges them with theft, for that they incroached vpon a place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to God, and profaned it with their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise. Now in this regard Christ had iust cause thus to deale.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because God was wronged,<note place="margin">Fearefull to rob God of his right.</note> and robbed of his right: His house was conuerted to another house then he had appointed; of an <hi>Oratory</hi> made a <hi>Market-house.</hi> Where learne, what a fearefull sinne it is to prophane holy things: If such a crime to rob God of a materiall Temple, which had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremoniall holinesse, what then is it to rob him of his spirituall Temple, thy soule and body, and to make it a stye for Satan, as the vncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and drunkard doe? The like sinne it is to rob God of his time, the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to prophane his word, by turning it to iests, and lots sanctified for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moment, to play and recreation; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert goods giuen for the maintenance of Gods worship, to our owne priuate vses: All these are branches of this generall of deuouring things san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.25. which is there said to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, or a snare, and so here proued, drawing forth Christs whip to reuenge it. See <hi>Achans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in stealing the wedge of gold, that the Lord had appoynted for him, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. and of <hi>Belshazzar</hi> prophaning but the cups of the Temple, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because here was horrible couetousnesse, that was the ground of all this, and that coloured with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:199:31"/> hypocrisie: Their pretence was godly, that all was done to further Gods worship; but their end was the filling of their purses: First, in the sellers, that in this regard sold the dearer, because of the commodiousnesse, and perhaps also of the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the place, as though they were the fitter for sacrifice, because sold in so holy a place: Then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the Priests, because the sacrifices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had their parts, were offered more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, and no doubt but they fleeced the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants besides for their standing in the Temple.</p>

See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>The Lord whom yee seeke, shall speedily come to</hi> his <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Temple being a figure of the Church,<note place="margin">Christ the Lord of his Church.</note> which <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> is <hi>the house of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. This shewes that Christ is heyre and Lord of this house also. And reason good: for hee built it, and compacted eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry stone together. The particular members of the Church are liuing stones of this house and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and the whole Church is the house. Oh happy house who hath so happy a Master, that will not let it out to any tenants, <hi>Can.</hi> 8.11.12. but will continually reside in it himselfe, so watching ouer euery stone, that it shall not goe to any dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:199:32"/> who will presently make vp all the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. This is our comfort when wee are weather-beaten: O Lord, wee are thine house, thou hast built vs, and founded vs on thy Sonne: thou hast chosen to dwell in our hearts, <hi>Is.</hi> 66.2. Of whom should the house looke to be maintayned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, but of the owner? This is a comfort in the second place, when vniust Lords enter into the Church, and take possession of it, and vsurpe, as the Pope and his creatures: Christ hath the same right still to driue such out of the Church, as now hee had to driue these out of the Temple. Take heed in the last place, how thou hurtest this house, or the least stone therein: Remember whose house it is. If in common houses prophaned, the <hi>dead stones</hi> can cry out of the wall, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.11. against their Masters, then much more in this house can the <hi>liuing stones</hi> cry vnto their Master against their wrongers.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> This plainely shewes, that this fact of Christ is not to be drawne into imitation,<note place="margin">The Pope hath no power to disthrone Princes.</note> because hee did it vpon this ground, as hee was Lord of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by vertue of his Sonneship. Therefore the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> grossely abuse this place, that hence gather the power of the Pope to punish offenders, euen with corporall punishments, meaning depriuing Princes of their Kingdomes. Verily if hee alone can punish men corporally in the same manner that Christ did; if of himselfe without further helpe, hee can master such a multitude of enemies, as here Christ did, and make them flye before him, let him take this power into his hands: But he will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:199:32"/> be wifer then to vndertake such a businesse, for feare of fists about his eares. But if Christ did not whip so much as poore sheepe-sellers out of the Temple, but by the power and priuiledge of his Sonship, how can the Pope, a man, a worme, and no God, arrogate power to whip Princes out of their Thrones, in which Christ hath seated them?</p>
                  <p>Alike is the errour of others, who without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall calling from God, take vpon them to reforme publique abuses; for Christ did this as the Sonne of the Father, and King of the Church.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How farre forth is this action imitable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Men are eyther <hi>publique</hi> or <hi>priuate:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How farre this action of Christs whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping these out of the Temple is imitable.</note>
                     <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> eyther in the <hi>Magistracie</hi> or <hi>Ministery.</hi> As for the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> they being Christs vicegerents as God, in speciall manner the imitation of this fact belongs to them: for God hath giuen them the sword, not to let it lye rusting in the scabberd, but to strike; and he hath put the whip into their hands, to scourge withall: yea, <hi>Magistrates</hi> are the very whips of Christ, and so they must thinke, that the power of Christ is as an hand holding them fast, and enabling them to the whipping out of the Money-changers: And therefore hereupon should take speciall heart to themselues, as <hi>Hezekiah, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> and other worthy Magistrates haue done.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Ministers,</hi> the onely whip they may vse, is of their tongues, in powerfull preaching against abuses: And as here Christs whip of small cords, was more powerfull then <hi>Hercules</hi> Club, or then any Scorpions, or wyre scourges; so the faithfull preaching of the word alone, is oftentimes of all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:199:33"/> other meanes the most powerfull; as in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churches, destitute of the helpe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. This is that mighty thunder-cracke, that causes Sathan, with all his packe of corruptions, to fall downe, like lightning.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>private men;</hi> neyther hath God tyed their tongues, though hee hath their hands: As occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is offered they may shew their detestation and dislike of corruptions: They may sigh, and pray, and supplicate; but other violence, saue of their prayers to God, may they vse none. And this is all they may doe, in regard of <hi>publique</hi> abuses: But now in regard of <hi>priuate</hi> abuses in their owne houses and hearts, the case is otherwise; and here all are to imitate Christs example: Euery Christians family is a Church; The gouernours are to take the whip into their hands, and to scoure the family of <hi>Hagars</hi> and <hi>Ishmaels,</hi> as <hi>Dauid, Ps.</hi> 101. So euery Christians heart is a Temple of the holy Ghost, and therefore by the whip of seuere mortification and repentance, hee is to scourge out the secret corruptions lurking in his heart: And this is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Popish whipping, who by whipping themselues with a materiall whip, seeme to shew that they are like those Money-changers, that neede the same whip to driue them out of the Church.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Occasion</hi> was <hi>Nicodemus</hi> first speech, whereby hee prouoked our Sauiour. His speech consists of two parts: First, a question not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but implyed in the Verse following, when it is said, that <hi>Iesus answered;</hi> whereby it appeares that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> spake more then is set downe, and demanded this question, What is necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> That of all other thoughts and cares, this of eternall life<note place="margin">Greatest care should be for life eternall.</note> should most of all possesse vs, how we might attaine thereunto: for it is the maine end of our life. It were absurd for a merchants factor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:199:49"/> to giue in his accounts of his time and money spent, so much in dauncing, so much in dicing, hunting and drinking, when negotiation was the end of his masters sending him ouer: And as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd for vs, to giue in our accounts to God, of our dayes spent in worldly pleasures and affayres, in idlenesse and vanitie, when God placed vs here to labour for heauen. And yet wee doe, as if in a race where the prize were a wedge of gold, the runners should runne after euery feather they see in the way, and neglect the prize they runne for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, in <hi>Nicodemus</hi> speech is a reason of asking this question of Iesus, which no doubt hee premised by way of insinuation: for it might be obiected by our Sauiour, as the woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Chap.</hi> 4. against our Sauiour, <hi>Thou art a Iew, and askest water of me a Samaritan:</hi> so, Thou of the Pharisees, who are mine enemies, and thinke your se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ues the onely Rabbies, and come to mee to learne. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> therefore preuents this, and shewes, first, by the title of <hi>Rabbi</hi> giuen to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that he thought it more deseruedly belonged to him, then to himselfe, or any of his owne Tribe: And secondly, by the words following, that not onely himselfe, but euen the most malicious Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees were in conscience conuinced of the truth of his calling. And the meanes of this conuiction he shewes to be his miracles.</p>
                  <p>Marke the honour that God doth his faithfull Ministers<note place="margin" type="runSum">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:199:50"/> insinuates it selfe euen into their eyes that wilfully wincke, that they might not see. It is a comfort to poore Ministers: Such as vse vs but harshly, are yet forced in their hearts to thinke reuerently of vs, and to acknowledge vs sent of God.</p>

For Christ being the fountain of this life, Faith is the Conduit-pipe that conueyes it to vs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Now before generation there is no fountaine nor conduit-pipe of life. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.13. Faith is made an effect of Regeneration, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.

                  <p n="1">1. Euery life seekes its owne preseruation:<note place="margin">Which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by 7. Properties.</note> Plants draw nourishment out of the earth: the young ones of bruite beasts runne to the teates of the dammes so soone as they are borne: Looke how a naturall life seekes that which is fit for that life, so doth this spirituall life that which is fit for it selfe, as the word of God, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new borne babes desire the sincere milke of the word:</hi> and the things that are aboue, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If yee be risen with Christ,</hi> seeke <hi>the things that are aboue.</hi> Looke how the beasts of the earth will seeke after grasse, the Lion after his prey, the naturall worldly man after the profits and promotions of the world; so will the regenerate after the foode of his soule, after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly honours and preferments. The labouring
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:199:52"/> after the meate that perisheth, for the belly, for the backe, for the pride and pompe of this life, shewes wee are not yet risen with Christ to this spirituall life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>Life</hi> seekes its preseruation, so specially of him, and by him, that is the authour of it: So the young ones of bruites, seeke of their dammes, children of their parents, <hi>asking bread</hi> of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. yea, and the eyes of all the creatures are lift vp to the Creator, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. So here in this life they that haue it, euer and anone are running to their father, to maintaine this sparkle of life in them, to furnish them with all necessary supplyes. The new borne babe, by crying, begs helpe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently: So doe these new borne babes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.3. They shall bring voluntary oblations, <hi>euen from the wombe:</hi> so reades <hi>Iunius.</hi> Our <hi>inuocation</hi> of God, necessarily followes Gods <hi>vocation</hi> of vs. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.23. <hi>I will say to them, Thou art my people: And they shall say, My God.</hi> And so soone as sonnes, <hi>wee cry Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15. See <hi>Sauls</hi> example, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Life</hi> feeles that which is an enemie to it, as sicknesse: The more life the greater sense of sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

And hence he is called, the <hi>Lord of life, Acts</hi> 3.15. &amp; 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the son, hath life,</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. we are said to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten again, by the resurrection of Christ.</hi> And this is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199:58"/> that <hi>vertue of his Resurrection, Phil.</hi> 3 10. whereby hee raises vs vp to a spirituall life. And yet Christ himselfe giues this action of begetting vs, to the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because hee doth all things by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His Spirit is the bond of vnion, to ioyne vs to Christ the fountaine of this life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His Spirit doth quicken the Word, which is the seede whereof wee are begotten, euen as there is a spirit in the materiall seed which makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lificall. Hence as by the seede we vnderstand both the seede it selfe, and the spirit in it, so 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. by <hi>the seede of God,</hi> seemes to be meant both the word and the spirit in the word, quickening it to vs by faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> Take wee heede then how wee grieue the Spirit of Christ: Nature teaches not to grieue thy naturall Parents. This spirituall Father is farre aboue the naturall, who when they haue begot vs, neede not stand still by vs, to keepe that life in vs they haue giuen vs, for wee may liue though they dye: But here, as in the first Creation God was faine still to stand by his worke, and to support it by his prouidence; so in the second, after Christ by his Spirit hath begotten vs, hee must still with fresh and new supplyes maintaine this life in vs. That same <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.29. <hi>If thou turne away thy countenance, they are gone,</hi> may truely be applyed to the spirituall new creature in Christ. The Spirit is the conduit-pipe conueighing the life of Christ to vs: To grieue the Spirit, is to stop vp the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-pipe of this life. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>And grieue not the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199:59"/> Spirit, by which yee are sealed:</hi> And this is the seale of the Spirit, euen our Regeneration. So that it is in effect all one, as if he had said, <hi>Grieue not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which yee are begotten againe.</hi> Nay rather, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 100. <hi>Come, let vs fall downe before the Lord, for he hath made vs, not we our selues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>manner</hi> of the Spirits working is set forth in Regeneration by the word <hi>Water; Of Water and the Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>of spirituall water,</hi> opposed to the ceremoniall washings of the Pharisees, to which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> gaue too much: Or else, which in effect is all one, <hi>of the Spirit working like Water.</hi> Reasons of this exposition are these: First, collation of other places, where the Spirit is set out by Water, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.38.39. <hi>Is.</hi> 44.3.4. Secondly, collation of this with that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>With the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> that is, working like fire: Thirdly, because the other interpretation vnderstanding it of Baptisme, cannot stand: First, because in the Papists owne iudgements, men may be saued without Baptisme, as was the Theefe on the Crosse. Secondly, it should seeme that Christs Baptisme, which the Papists distinguish from <hi>Iohns,</hi> and hold onely necessary to saluation, was not yet extant; for this conference with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was in the very first beginnings of Christs ministry, as appeares by the computation of the time. Thirdly, it was not likely, that Christ would speake to such a nouice, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was, of the Sacraments, and that so sparingly and obscurely, before hee had learned his Catechisme, and so were fitted for them: as wee see <hi>Peter</hi> did not, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. till he had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:199:59"/> pricked their hearts and wrought Repentance. Fourthly, Water then should not haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit, who is the chiefe and principall agent. Fiftly, in the next verse onely the Spirit is repeated, which shewes that <hi>Water</hi> is sufficiently included in <hi>Spirit.</hi> Sixtly, Christ afterward taxeth <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that being a Legall Doctor, hee knew not these things: Now the Law taught the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Spirit, but the Law medled not with the Sacraments of the new Testament.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit in Regeneration worketh like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. First, <hi>Water</hi> hath the property of <hi>ablution,</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> The Spirit compared to Water, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, 1. Of Ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to wash away the filth of our bodies: So the <hi>Spirit: first,</hi> besprinckling vs with the bloud of Christ, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth vs that the guilt of sinne is taken away; and <hi>secondly,</hi> applying to vs the vertue of Christs death, causes sinne to dye, and so washes away the filth of sinne, and sanctifies vs: And this is the first degree of spirituall life, to haue sinne dye and decay in vs, as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.20. ioynes his being crucified with Christ, and liuing by faith in Christ, together. Secondly, <hi>Water</hi> causes <hi>fruitfulnesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Of Fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> as drought doth famine, <hi>Iob</hi> 8.11. <hi>Can a rush grow without mire, or grasse without water?</hi> Hence was <hi>Aegypts</hi> fruitfulnesse, because of <hi>Nilus</hi> his invnda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And hence the regenerate man is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the trees, planted by the riuers of water, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. because the presence of the holy Ghost is the same to them, that waters to the Willowes. Excellent for this purpose is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.3.4. <hi>I will poure water vpon the thirsty, and flouds vpon the dry ground: I will poure my Spirit vpon thy seede, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199:60"/> my blessing vpon thy buds: and they shall grow as among the grasse, and as willowes by the riuers of waters.</hi> And then in the fift Verse followes the fruit of this growth by the Spirits watring, a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous profession of the mouth, and subscription of the hand to the truth. Our barrennesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitablenesse shewes that the Spirit waters vs not, and that wee haue not the <hi>washing of the new birth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Of Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note>
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. Thirdly, a third property of <hi>Water</hi> is <hi>cooling,</hi> and allaying of heate, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.1. Thus is the Spirit as water also to vs, to coole the heate of our raging and accusing consciences, pursued by the Law, vsually, in the very first beginnings of our Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>The second Point followes. The <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Assertion</hi> thus interpreted.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Confirmation</hi> is this:</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is wanting. The <hi>Assumption</hi> is proued in this sixt Verse, by an opposition: That which is borne of the flesh is carnall, and therefore whatsoeuer is spirituall, must be borne of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>sense.</hi> Of the flesh, that is, of man, after a fleshly manner, of the seede of man and woman: The same with <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13. <hi>The will of the flesh, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:199:60"/> of man, and of bloud:</hi> for the word <hi>flesh</hi> here in the beginning of the sentence, doth not note the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, as in the end; but man the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, together with the seede the matter of our generation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> First, from the obiection of <hi>Nicodemus, Verse</hi> 4. and so the scope of Christ going about to proue, that our naturall generation opens no way for vs into heauen. Secondly, from the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the second part of the Verse; <hi>That which is borne of the spirit is spirit:</hi> for as there the word <hi>spirit</hi> in the latter clause differs from it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, so by proportion here <hi>flesh</hi> in the latter clause differs from <hi>flesh</hi> in the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is flesh,]</hi> that is, is fleshly, corrupted with origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne. <hi>[Of the spirit,]</hi> that is, the holy Spirit, whereof hee spake, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>[Is spirit,]</hi> that is, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of an holy and spirituall nature.</p>

                  <p>There is a second way also, whereby in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion corruption is conueyed, namely, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the seede, <hi>Iob</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse?</hi> And afterward, <hi>Vers.</hi> 31. of this <hi>Chapter, Hee that is of the earth, is of the earth.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Dauid</hi> sayes that his very first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which was before the infusion of the soule, was in sinne.

Neyther by this reason doe wee make the Faith of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans an vnreasonable and senslesse Faith. Faith is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:199:66"/> not in the bruite part of the soule, but in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the very apple of the eye of Reason; and as the ancients speake the reason of Reason. Faith therfore is neuer contrary to right Reason, though it be to the corruption of Reason: For right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must needes yeeld, that whatsoeuer God sayes it must needes be true. This is onely the scope of this doctrine, to teach Reason to know her place, that shee presume not to checke Faith, nor grow not presumptuous, as here in <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> When this <hi>Hagar</hi> is thus malapert with <hi>Sarah,</hi> then must <hi>Sarah</hi> take downe <hi>Hagar.</hi> Reason is a good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to follow Faith, an ill vsher to goe before it: Hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.69. <hi>Wee beleeue and know;</hi> first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and then, know.

And this is the highest obedience wee can performe to God, to beleeue him on his bare word, correcting the errour of Reason by Faith, as we doe correct the errour of sense, thinking a straight staffe croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the water, by reason.</p>
                  <p>But here marke, that though Reason must be captiuated to Faith, yet not to fancy, and to the idle conceits of men, without the word: As in the matter of the Sacrament, where God would not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:199:67"/> onely haue Reason, but Sense vsed, there forsooth we must be blinde and senslesse, and beleeue that Christs body is there corporally present: And yet in Predestination that profound Mystery, where wee should cry out, <hi>Oh the deepnesse!</hi> they will vse the greatest curiosity of Reason that can be.</p>
                  <p>The exaltation of Faith aboue reason is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the promises, when with <hi>Abraham</hi> wee can <hi>hope against hope,</hi> and apprehend the certaine accomplishment of them by Faith, when Sense and carnall Reason see nothing but the contrary, as that godlinesse should be gainfull vnto vs, euen in the things of this life, when for Religion sake, we are spoyled of all wee haue.</p>

                  <p>Now for the particulars of the similitude, which stands thus: As it is with the winde, so it is with the Spirit in Regeneration: for that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words, <hi>So is euery one that is borne of the Spirit.</hi> See the like, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.45. The winde blowes in the ayre, so doth the Spirit in mans heart, and as freely as the winde blowes, and as sensibly as the winde blowes, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as incomprehensibly as the winde blowes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And God comming to call <hi>Adam</hi> to repentance, comes in a winde, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. But let vs see how the Spirit blowes like a winde.</p>

As the Lord vsed the winde to bring Quailes abundantly to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and still doth to bring in great tydes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So by his Spirit doth hee bring all grace vnto vs; and when this winde blowes, oh the tydes of repenting teares, as in <hi>Dauid</hi> after the Spirit had blowed vpon him in <hi>Nathans</hi> ministry. So the winde from the bellowes quickens and reuiues the fire: The Spirit likewise with his blowing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues those sparkles of the heauenly fire in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of our hearts, which otherwise would dye.

With his blasts hee throwes downe the strong holds and castles of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, euen the high Cedars, and lofty mountaines, that exalt themselues against Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. hee rends our rocky hearts in pieces, and makes the whole frame of them to tremble: As in the Iayler, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. when the naturall winde caused an earth-quake, this spirituall winde caused an heart-quake, and made him come quiuering to the Apostles, <hi>Sirs, what shall I doe to be saued?</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> was going feruently to <hi>Damascus</hi> to persecute, the euill Spirit, an vnhappy winde, draue him amaine,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:199:69"/> but there was a contrary winde that met him, and draue him backward, vnhorsed him, flung him downe to the ground.

When the spirituall winde blowes powerfully vpon vs, how are wee carryed then? With what ease, facilitie, and power, performe wee Christian duties of Prayer, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, &amp;c.

As hee must needs runne to, and in wickednes, whom the Diuell driues: so in good things, whom the Spirit driues. As, this winde <hi>blowing</hi> in our faces, we are driuen out of our sinnes; so in the wayes of God, blowing on our backes, we are furthered in grace.

                  <p>This liberty of Spirit shewes it selfe fiue wayes:</p>

Once this <hi>Winde</hi> blew in the East, and how famous were those Churches? But the winde is turned now into the West, and not the least whisper now of this <hi>winde</hi> to be heard there.

                  <p>The Argument is this: Ignorance in the grounds of Religion is shamefull in any, though but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon learner, much more in a Doctor: But thou a Doctor in Israel, art ignorant in the very <hi>ABC</hi> of Religion.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It is lavvfull to vpraid our brethren vvith their defects, so that foure cautions be obserued.</note>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, so these cautions be obserued: First, that wee doe it not insultingly, to grace our selues in our brothers disgrace. Christ did not so here: For alas, what great matter for Iesus Christ, the eternall Sonne of God, to be before <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in knowledge? Secondly, that in regard of our owne wants, and the conscience of them, we doe it more sparingly. Christ was omniscious, the best of vs are ignorant; and therefore in blaming others, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we our owne wants, and blame them. Thirdly,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:199:76"/> that wee vpbraid not repenting and humbled sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who happily exceede in vpbraiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but the bold, impudent, and proud, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues in their wants: As here Christ did <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that stood in his owne light, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe for his wit and reason. Fourthly, wee must doe it with commiseration, as if giuing a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to a sicke man: So did Christ here, seeking to regenerate <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> which could not be till hee were thus humbled. And thus also did hee, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. his Disciples. And <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Hebrewes, Heb.</hi> 5.12.</p>

Thinke not that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance shall excuse, when Christ thus vpbraids with it: And yet how many that will be ashamed of other ignorance, but not of this? This is the fault of our times; the first elements of Religion are not knowne, no not of many professors: and so a Sermon to them is as a Greeke Lecture in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> would be to a boy neuer entered into his <hi>Greeke Grammer.</hi>

                  <p>The first heauenly Mysterie is concerning the Propheticall office of Christ, that hee onely, and none else, is able of himselfe, to vnderstand the Mysteries of Gods kingdome, and so to reueale them to his Church, whereby hee makes good his speech in the former <hi>Verse.</hi>

Yet here is comfort, that Christ hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen, and entred into Gods owne bosome, for this hee hath done for all our benefits. And that which <hi>Maximilian</hi> dying added to this place, vnderstanding it of Christs bodily ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>No man hath ascended but the sonne of man,</hi> and said hee, <hi>all that beleeue in him,</hi> the same is true also vnderstanding it of diuine Mysteries. And in this sense may wee say, as well as <hi>Bernard</hi> in the other; <hi>Etsi solus, at profecto totus intrabit, nec os comminuetur ex eo: Although hee shall enter in alone, yet shall hee enter in whole, neyther shall a bone of him be broken.</hi> Now the faithfull are as it were the bones and flesh of Christ.

                  <p>The second heauenly Mysterie is concerning the two natures, and their vnion in Christ.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but because in assuming the humane nature here on earth, there seemed some abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as it were a leauing of heauenly glory, therefore in regard of the assumption of our flesh, he is said to descend from heauen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His <hi>humane nature,</hi> in the words, <hi>Sonne of man:</hi> which shewes that hee was not immediately and miraculously framed by the power of God, as <hi>Adam,</hi> who though hee were man, yet not the sonne of man, but was conceiued of the seede of the Virgin, and so was not onely man, but <hi>the sonne of man.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. was made a curse for vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No likelihood that a brasen Serpent should heale the stinging of a liuing fiery Serpent; nay,<note place="margin">Christ and the brasen Serpent matched in 7. things.</note> some write, that it is deadly for those stung with a Serpent to looke vpon brasse: So it may seeme against reason, that life should come to vs by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, health by anothers sicknesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Brasen Serpent</hi> had the likenesse of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but not the poyson: So Christ came in the similitude of sinfull flesh, void yet of all sinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Brasen Serpent</hi> was lifted vp on a Pole: So Christ was likewise lifted vp, first, on the Crosse, in the publique view of all the people: secondly, hee and his Crosse, were, and still are, lifted vp in the publique Ministry, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. This also Christ seemes to imply here; As <hi>Moses</hi> the Legall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster lift vp the brasen Serpent, so must the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospell lift vp Christ, as it were on high, to be seene of all men: But alas, many lift vp themselues, not Christ.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the poyson of a Serpent was healed by a Serpent; so the sinne of man by man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. yet here is difference, that Christ had power in himselfe to heale vs, which the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Serpent had not.</p>

The stung Israelite looked on the Serpent with a pittifull, humble, crauing, wishly eye, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping also for the very paine of the sting: with such an eye doth the beleeuing sinner looke on Christ crucified, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They shall looke on him whom they haue pierced, and shall lament, as one mourneth for his first borne.</hi> Faith is not a fond fantasticall imagination that Christ dyed for thee, but it is an earnest, affectionate, and intentiue fastning of thy minde on Christ, euen as the stung Israelite fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his eye on the brasen Serpent, or as the sicke man lookes on his Physitian when he desires ease. This Metaphor excellently expresses the nature of Faith; for in the eye is not only contemplation,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:199:83"/> but affection, loue, sorrow, desire, expectation. Such a Faith then, as is onely a conceit of the braine is vaine and idle.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Israelite by looking on the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, receiued ease presently, and was rid of the poyson of the liuing Serpent, and so therein was made, like the brasen Serpent, void of all poyson: So the beleeuer, by looking on Christ, is eased of his guilty accusing conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. and is transformed into the Image of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Euen the squint-ey'd or pur-blinde Israelite was healed; so the weake beleeuer, being a true beleeuer, is healed by Christ.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though the Israelite were stung neuer so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet if hee looked vp to the Serpent, hee was healed: As wee are daily stung by sinne, so wee must daily looke vp to Christ crucified: Euery new sinne must haue a fresh act of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>Yet there are two differences betwixt their loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the Serpent,<note place="margin">Yet sin two things they differ.</note> and our looking by Faith on Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By looking they liued, but yet so that after they dyed; but here by beleeuing in Christ, wee gaine an eternall life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They looked on the Serpent, but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent could not looke on them; but here, as thou lookest on Christ, so hee on thee, as once on <hi>Peter,</hi> and on <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> from the Crosse, and thy comfort must rather be in Christs looking on thee, then in thy looking on him</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For instruction what to doe when stung
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:199:84"/> in conscience, and when Death it selfe comes to sting thee, and is in stinging thee: thou must then lift vp the eye of Faith vnto Christ, and hee will cast downe the eye of grace on thee, and driue away all the poyson from thee: thou must then say as <hi>Iehoshaphat, I know not what to doe, but mine eyes are lifted vp to thee</hi> lifted vp on the Crosse, and there triumphing ouer this Sathan, and ouer this Death. Many when they are stung by the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, goe to looke on this idle sight, and that vaine Booke: But this is to put more Serpents into their bosomes to sting them worse. The onely way is to looke on Christ crucified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. It is comfort to those that doe beleeue: No poyson can hurt them, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.18. They may walke on the Basiliske, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. As the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites might insult ouer the Serpents, when once they had the brasen Serpent; so now may the true beleeuer triumph in Christ, and may say with <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, Lord, now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, for mine eyes haue seene that sauing thing of thine:</hi> and with <hi>Paul, O Death, where is thy sting?</hi> Be thy sinnes neuer so great, looke on Christ, and thou shalt haue helpe, as they that were stung most dangerously were healed by looking on the brasen Serpent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Tryall whether wee beleeue in Christ or no, then shall wee finde ease, peace, and comfort of Conscience, and the blessed beginnings of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life in vs. As long as the poyson of the old Serpent remaines in men, let them talke of their Faith in Christ as long as they will. If the sting
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:199:84"/> of the Serpent stickes in thy flesh, thine eye stickes not in Christ crucified.</p>

But perhaps though this gift brings so great profit, yet they to whom it is giuen, must take some great and extraordinary paines to get it, and then Gods loue is not so great. Therefore, Sixtly, it is set forth by the easinesse of the meanes whereby wee are possessed of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this gift, <hi>That whosoeuer beleeueth.</hi> Yet if this so worthy a gift, of such inualuable worth to the enioyer, had beene restrained to some few sorts of men, the matter had not beene so much; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Seauenthly, it is set forth by the vniuersality, that <hi>whosoeuer;</hi> be he what hee will, so he will but reach forth his hand to take this gift, he shall haue it, and all the comfort of it.</p>

Wee must then distinguish of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: First, there is a weaker Knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee vnderstand that there are such things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto vs in the word: Secondly, a clearer Knowledge, whereby wee apprehend the things themselues, and how they are. The former must needes goe before Faith, the second followes it in the life to come. Before wee can beleeue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinitie, the hypostaticall vnion, &amp;c. we must know that such things are reuealed in the word, though the things themselues surpasse our vnderstandings.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2. The Means.</note> of it. It is the hearing of the Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing. Luke</hi> 24.45. <hi>Then hee opened their vnderstanding,</hi> namely, in hearing him open the Scriptures. This discouers the common faith to be a false faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause conceiued without the word: It is a bastard Faith, it is not lawfully begotten. Let them neuer professe faith that eyther neglect hearing, or heare irreuerently. True Faith is the daughter of the Ministry, and therefore cannot but reuerence her parent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Order</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. The Order.</note> of Gods working it. It is thus to be considered: First, the Law presents thee with the sight of thy sinnes and misery: Secondly, it workes in thee compunction and terrour, the spirit of bondage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. so that thou cryest out, <hi>What shall I doe, Act.</hi> 2.37. Then thirdly, the Law is made thy Schoole-master to Christ, and thou beginnest to consider seriously of the Gospell, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:199:90"/> the promises thereof. Fourthly, vpon this serious consideration, beleeuing that thy sinnes are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, thou conceiuest an hearty hungring after mercy, and afterward Faith to apprehend mercy. Fiftly, this thy longing causes thee with a broken and a bleeding heart, purposing no longer to sin, to cry for mercy, and to hold out in crying, with strong sighes and sobs. Sixtly, vpon this followes some quieting of the heart, in some assurance of pardon, and being thus bred, it is confirmed by the frequent vse of the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and exercises of Repentance, and daily experience of Gods goodnesse. This serues.</p>

No, wee teach that a man is to be hammered and humbled by the Law, that hee is to be pinched with feeling his want of Christ, to be exercised with longing desires, and to exercise himselfe in long and many prayers, before hee can haue the least assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If at the present thou feelest these things, or the chiefest of them, it is well: for our Faith is in working euery day, and oftentimes the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings are not so easily discerned: as we discerne
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:199:91"/> not the sprouting of the Plant when it first bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Marke</hi> 4.26. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But is there not Faith till there be some assurance felt quieting the minde?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, when thy soule is like the thirsty ground in desiring the bloud of Christ, then is Faith begunne, then is Christ receiued, though thou feele it not. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst.</hi> To eate the flesh and drinke the bloud of Christ, is to beleeue; but whosoeuer hungers after his flesh, hath already eaten, who so thirsteth after Christs bloud, hath already drunken. Desire of Faith is an argument of Loue, Loue of Knowledge, Knowledge of Experience; for Faith is knowne chiefly experimentally: Therefore <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Come therefore, taste and see how gracious the Lord is.</hi> First, we <hi>taste</hi> before we <hi>see,</hi> feele in our own experience, before wee know Gods sweetnesse. And vnlesse a man by his owne taste, hath felt the sweetnesse of Christ, hee cannot desire him. Pregnant is to this purpose that place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.3. <hi>As new borne babes desire the sincere milke of the word:</hi> but hee addes, <hi>If so be yee haue tasted how good the Lord is.</hi> So that there must first be a tasting of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, before there can be a desiring: where also note that <hi>desiring</hi> is a property of a new borne babe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the <hi>Manner</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4 The Manner.</note> how the hand of Faith is to apprehend, and the eye is to see Christ. A point worthy our consideration, that thereby wee may yet better discerne true faith from fained. This right manner of apprehension is in sixe points.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:199:91"/>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">In sixe things. 1. As God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and giues.</note> Faiths receiuing hand presupposes Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and giuing hand: So that true Faith receiues Christ as a gift out of his Fathers hand. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke where God hath an hand to giue, there, and there onely hath Faith an hand to receiue. Now Gods hand opens it selfe to giue Christ and his Spirit to vs in the holy exercises of hearing the Word, receiuing the Sacraments, and hearty Prayer: And therefore Faith comes and layes hold on, and receiues Christ in the vse of these. In hearing the Word, and receiuing the Supper, to meditate vpon the promise of mercy, and in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating to apply: this is the manner of true Faiths applying. Therefore that Faith which apprehends Christ otherwise, in the neglect and contempt of the meanes, is meere presumption, and an idle fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a wandring braine. A true beleeuer may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Christ when hee is out of these exercises, yet this apprehension is the fruit of his former vse of these exercises, and it is nothing so sweet as in the vse of these exercises. When wee are in prayer then the Lord sends downe his Spirit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the promises, and making vs to cry <hi>Abbi</hi> my Father. When wee are in hearing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, then the same Spirit seizeth on vs, as on <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Thou that braggest of thy full perswasion, try it by this: Doest thou feele that it being but faint and feeble at other times, yet in the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer to receiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table encrease of strength: Alas, nothing lesse, but rather it is weakned, because the Word it is an enemy to presumption, and therefore shakes it,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:199:92"/> but a friend to true Faith, and therefore it feedes and fosters it: So that here is a liuely difference betweene Faith and Presumption.<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Faith &amp; Presumption.</note> First, <hi>Faith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues Christ, <hi>Presumption</hi> snatches at him: <hi>Faith</hi> receiues him at Gods hand reaching him forth in the meanes, <hi>Presumption</hi> sawcily and impudently offers to snatch him, not seeing Gods hand open it selfe. Then secondly, presumptuous apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is apprehended, arrested, arraigned, as a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, by the ministry of the word, and the winde thereof blowes it downe, as a Spiders web, in which regard the presumptuous beleeuer hates the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; but the true apprehension is cherished, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and encouraged in the Word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Apprehension of Faith is with feeling of sweetnesse<note place="margin">2. With sense of sweetnesse.</note> in Christ and in the promises, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>eating and drinking of his flesh, Ioh.</hi> 6. and Faith is the Palate of our soules mouth, and therefore in this exquisite daintie it must needes finde a speciall sweetnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy louing kindnesse</hi> [apprehended by Faith] <hi>is better then life.</hi> So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>If so be yee haue tasted how good the Lord is. Psal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Taste yee and see how gracious the Lord is,</hi> that is, beleeue in him; as appeares by the reason added, <hi>Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</hi> Hence arises the loue and ioy in Christ, as immediate fruits of Faith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.56. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. For as with naturall food is ioyned naturall gladnesse, in regard of the contentment it ministers to the hungry stomacke, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their hearts with food and gladnesse:</hi> so also with spirituall food is ioyned spirituall ioy. And as in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:199:92"/> eating these earthly meates, whilest in eating wee finde pleasure in them, our affections are stirred vp towards them; so also towards Christ, feeding on him by Faith, so that wee cannot but cry out, oh the sweetnesse of this flesh! and euen desire others to eate of it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> inuiting others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.8. For Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the promises, not onely as <hi>true,</hi> and so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents; but as <hi>good</hi> and <hi>sweet,</hi> and so adheres and cleaues vnto them. And as in couenants betweene men, assent is shewed by wishing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.34. so doth Faith in the couenant of grace: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. the Patriarches are said to salute the promises. Salutation is with embracing and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of affection.</p>
                  <p>Here is another difference betweene Faith and Presumption: for presumption feeles no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in Christs bloud then in a chip, but true Faith doth, because it felt first the sowrenesse of sinne. It was scorched with the sense of Gods anger, whence comes thirsting after his bloud, which is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable as cleare water in drought. Looke with what comfort the condemned malefactor at the gallowes, receiues his pardon, with the same doth the beleeuer receiue Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">3. With Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</note> This apprehension of Christ must be with an humbled and contrite heart for sinne: <hi>Come vnto mee,</hi> that is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.35. Beleeue in mee, <hi>all yee that are weary and heauy laden, Mat.</hi> 11. And <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They shall looke vpon mee, whom they haue pierced, and they shall lament for him.</hi> The eye of Faith is a lamenting eye, a sorrowfull eye: for it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:199:93"/> beholds Christ pierced with the beleeuers owne sinnes. The Passeouer was to be eaten with sowre hearbs, and Christ the true Passeouer with griefe of heart for our sinnes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The apprehension of true Faith is with a strife<note place="margin">4. With Strife, and</note> against our owne infidelitie, and Sathans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to doubting, and in the end with victory ouer them. Here then are two things: first, <hi>Strife:</hi> secondly, <hi>Victory.</hi> First, there must be <hi>Strife,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Sathan is an enemie to true Faith, and will oppose it, and God being a friend to it, will by this meanes haue it tryed and confirmed. Here is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene Presumption and Faith: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous man brags of his Faith, that it is so strong, that hee nothing doubts of his saluation: the true beleeuer, wearyed with continuall doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, cryes out, <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbeliefe.</hi> And hence to the presumptuous nothing more easie then Faith; to the true beleeuer that feeles this conflict betweene Faith and Doubtings, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more difficult. Hence Faith is called the <hi>Faith of Gods power, Col.</hi> 2.12. and wee are said to beleeue by Gods mighty power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there needes no such power to beget a presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming imaginary perswasion. Such ill weedes grow ouer-fast of themselues, and there needes that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer rather to destroy it then to build it. Further, Faith is Gods owne worke, and hee loues to haue his workes and graces tryed; and therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely lets Sathan loose vpon vs, to bait vs, and sometimes fights himselfe with vs, as with <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Iaakob.</hi> But Presumption being the Diuels worke,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:199:93"/> hee loues not to try it, lest hee should marre all, and so cause men to seeke for a better grounded perswasion. Then secondly, Faith in this strife gets the <hi>Victory</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Victory.</note> ouer all impediments, whereas in the euill day Presumption receiues the foyle, and giues the presumer the slip in his greatest neede; and therefore <hi>Iob</hi> 8. compared to the Spiders house: But true Faith neuer letting goe her gripe, with <hi>Iaakob Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>wrestles with the wrestlings of God, and gets the vpper-hand,</hi> as <hi>Rahel</hi> speakes of her selfe in another case, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.8. and so <hi>trusts in God though he kill her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Faith apprehends Christ with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of inferiour and dependant promises:<note place="margin">5. With appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> for looke as God makes his promises, so Faith receiues them; but God in making his promises, knits and tyes the inferiour promises of the things of this life, to the maine promises concerning Christ and saluation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Rom</hi> 8 32. therefore true Faith so receiues them. Here Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is againe conuinced: hee that crakes so much of his strong Faith, and assurance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his sinnes, how shakes hee in time of danger, when outward meanes of preseruation fayle? whereas if wee did relye on God for our soules, much more would we for our bodies, if for our eternall, much more for our temporall sa ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for by the same Faith that wee liue our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, wee must also liue our temporall life. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by the same iustifying Faith whereby hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued Christs birth, beleeued <hi>Isaacks</hi> also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. And it cannot be, but if wee beleeue that God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:199:94"/> hath giuen vs the greater blessings, wee should thinke hee should deny vs the lesser. How doth he trust God for a Kingdome, that will not trust him for a crust of bread?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This Apprehension must be with transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation<note place="margin">6. With Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> of vs into the image of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Wee all behold the glory of the Lord,</hi> namely, by faith, <hi>and are changed into the same Image.</hi> Faith being as powerfull in this spirituall conception to worke in vs the image of the obiect seene, as phantasie is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the naturall conception. Meates eaten are turned into the nature of the eaters, here contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily eaters turned into the nature of meates eaten; beleeuers are fashioned according to the Image of Christ: for Faith receiues not a dead Christ, but Christ with his Spirit, a working, a stirring Spirit. <hi>The good ground receiues the seede of the Word,</hi> there is Faith, but marke the manner of receiuing, <hi>with a good and an honest heart, Luke</hi> 8.15. This disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers the vanitie of the common faith, so much bragged of, for the power of godlinesse is denyed. The right manner of applying Christ is in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to our selues, to apply our selues, with all our desires and endeuours to him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, otherwise we misapply. Away then with that fond, and foppish, phantasticall, idle, doting faith; and here is also the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt temporary and sauing Faith: Temporary Faith is begotten, not as presumption by fancy, but by the seede sowne, that is, the word, and it brings forth, by vertue of this seed some fruit, but yet the heart is rotten and vnsound, as <hi>Iudas</hi> still
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:199:94"/> retained his darling of couetousnesse, in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test heate of his profession, and therefore there was no thorow application of Christ, onely some slight taste, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. not a thorow eating or digestion, a superficiary floating in the top of the riuer of Christs bloud, no diuing to the bottome that they may be douzed thorowly, not feet only, but hands and head, and all.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Want of certainty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. For want of certaintie.</note> by reason it is ouerwhelmed with so many doubtings, so that the youngling in Christ, and the weake beleeuer cannot say boldly, <hi>Christ is mine,</hi> and yet neyther dares hee say, <hi>Christ is not mine.</hi> As he cannot boldly challenge Christs righteousnesse, so neyther can hee wholly deny it to himselfe: for there is a two-fold certainty: first, of <hi>Euidence:</hi> secondly, of <hi>Adherence.</hi> The weake beleeuer, though he want the certaintie of <hi>Euidence,</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:199:95"/> that though the truth of this proposition, <hi>My sinnes are pardoned,</hi> be not <hi>euident</hi> to his vnderstanding, yet he wants not the certainty of <hi>adherence,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in his will hee stickes and cleaues to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, saying still, It is good for mee to cleaue to the Lord: but the certaintie of <hi>euidence</hi> is so weake and so ouer-mastered by infidelitie, that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this Faith is called <hi>vnbeliefe; Lord, I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeliefe,</hi> that is, my weake and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Faith, so full of doubting, that it deserues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called vnbeliefe then Faith: for vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe should be wholly taken away, not holpen.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons of this weaknesse are two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Want of experience, and therefore it is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at our first conuersion, when as yet nouices, and are not thorowly acquainted with Gods man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing with his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Violence of Temptation, specially if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and cause vs to fall into some more grieuous sin: then the Faith before strong becomes weake, as in <hi>Dauids</hi> adultry, and <hi>Peters</hi> deniall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Strong</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Strong.</note> Apprehension when a man hath a sure and a firme gripe of Christ, not onely betwixt his finger and thumbe, as it were, but hath clasped him with both his hands, yea, both his armes, so that hee can say with <hi>Iaakob, I will not let thee goe, Gen.</hi> 32.26. And with <hi>Paul, Nothing shall separate, Rom.</hi> 8. This is called a <hi>plerophory,</hi> or a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, as was in <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Being fully assured.</hi> And it is gotten, when after long practise, and paynes taken in a godly life, and after many obseruations of Gods kindnesse, wee are become
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:199:95"/> experienced and exercised Christians. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. throughout. Now this promise here is made to the first, as well as to the second degree: for weake Faith is true Faith, as well as strong. When a man striues to apprehend, and stretches out his withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hand, desiring hee could apprehend, bewailing the inabilitie of it to apprehend, crying earnestly for mercy, that because hee cannot apprehend Christ, Christ would apprehend him, that because hee cannot apply Christ, Christ would apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his conscience; when a man I say, doth but thus much, hee beleeues, and whosoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, shall not perish, but haue eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the <hi>Act</hi> of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Obiect</hi> followes. The <hi>Obiect</hi> of Faith,<note place="margin">2. The Obiect of Faith.</note> it is <hi>Christ;</hi> whosoeuer should beleeue in <hi>Him:</hi> or the Gospell and the Promises thereof, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. It is called <hi>the word of Faith.</hi> Yet first the Promise, and then Christ who is promised as a gift: So in a word, Christ reuealed in the promises of the Gospell, is the <hi>Obiect</hi> of Faith. Wherein is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Faith and the knowledge of Christ in the life to come, which considereth him in himselfe, but Faith beholds him in the glasse of the Gospell, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> Other things are the <hi>Obiect</hi> of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, euen the whole truth of the Bible, as the Creation of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Faith beleeues the Creation, and all other holy truths, euen iustifying Faith: (for of that Faith it seemes the Apostle speakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. both by the end of the former Chapter, and the third verse
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:199:96"/> of the 11. <hi>by it our elders obtained a good report</hi>) but not as imploying her selfe about them as her spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall obiect, but presupposing them as necessary antecedents. The reasonable soule in a man doth the same things which the sensitiue in beasts, yet not as her proper and peculiar acts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. Iustifying Faith beleeues other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises besides that of Christ, and saluation by him, as concerning strength in tentations, moderation of afflictions, comforts of this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but as appendants and appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to the maine and principall promise: for <hi>in Christ,</hi> that is, that fundamentall promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ, <hi>all,</hi> that is, the other depending, <hi>promises are Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar obiect then of iustifying Faith is the Euangelicall promise: other things are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, some as necessary antecedents, some as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequents of this. But Faith findes life and saluation, neyther in the histories of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. nor in the Legal commandements, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, promises, but onely in the Couenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine of the right <hi>Obiect</hi> of Faith, is to be marked against the Papists cunning, in words saying as much as wee, but in truth denying it. Faith, saith the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> beleeues all things contained in the word, specially that the wicked is iustified by <hi>Grace.</hi> But by <hi>Grace</hi> they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the habit of Charitie: and this is that, they say, Faith must hold, That when wee haue this grace of Charity, then for it wee are iustified.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:199:96"/> And so they make Faiths obiect not Christ, nor his righteousnesse without vs, but the dignitie of our owne inherent righteousnesse within vs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole current of Scripture, calling it <hi>the Faith of Christ, Rom.</hi> 3.22.26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                  <p>The persons to whom the benefits of Christs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> mediatorship belong: To all beleeuers, without any exception of any estate or condition; <hi>That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer beleeueth.</hi> None is excluded, but such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themselues. This is singular comfort in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: No matter for thy sinnes, whosoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues in Christ shall be saued. If thou haue beene neuer so great a sinner, yet thou art not excluded, if thou wilt embrace Iesus Christ by a true Faith. This must comfort thee also in thy meane estate in the world, for yet thou art not excluded out of Christ, if thou beleeue in him, be thou what thou wilt. <hi>Whosoeuer beleeues,</hi> the hainous sinner as well as the lesser; the poore begger, as well as the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Monarch, <hi>shall not perish, but haue life eternall.</hi>

                     <bibl>VERSE 17</bibl>
                     <hi>For God sent not his Sonne into the world, to iudge the world, but that the world through him should be saued.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is a further illustration of that said before, that God gaue his Sonne that we might be saued. The reason is from the contraries: eyther he was sent to iudge, or to saue; not to iudge or condemne, for there was no need of that, wee were already all in that estate of condemnation: therefore hee was sent to saue. And withall here is a preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Obiection, that might be made vpon
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:199:97"/> that in the former Verse, <hi>God so loued the world, that hee gaue his Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Though Christ be a stumbling blocke to many, and augment their condemnation, yet God sent him chiefly and principally for another end, namely, to saue. That many are not onely not saued, but more fearefully damned by meanes of Christ, it is not from the maine and direct end, God propounded in sending him, but it is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally by reason of their owne wilfulnesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing Christ.</p>

                  <p>The first in the former words; <hi>Hee that beleeueth in him is not condemned,</hi> that is, by a Meicosis, is absolued, iustified, as in the third Commandement, not holding guiltlesse is holding guilty.</p>
                  <p>The sinner comes to be interested in Christs obedience, and so discharged of his sinnes,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Faith iustifies and discharges the sinner.</note> and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, onely by beleeuing in Christ. After his cause is remoued into the Euangelicall Court, the tryall is by Faith; <hi>Hee that beleeueth is not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Pauls</hi> labour was, that <hi>hee might be found</hi> (namely, when the search and triall of his cause should be before Gods tribunall) <hi>hauing the righteousnesse of Christ by Faith.</hi> And,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:199:99"/> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.10. The Lord is maruellous in glorifying the elect at the last day, <hi>because the Gospell was belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by them.</hi> That at the last day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. workes are brought in, it is onely to giue witnesse of the truth of our plea of Faith.

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Here is rich comfort to euery beleeuer: This is his happy priuiledge, that hee is not liable to damnation, that hee is iustified in Gods Court from his sinnes: for by Faith he is made one with Christ, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>No condemnation to those that are in Christ.</hi> Christ is <hi>iustified,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 16. that is, discharged of thy sinnes: Thou canst be no more called to a reckoning for them then Christ can, if by Faith thou haue apprehended Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

                     </gap>y now answere the Law, I haue satisfied thee to the full, and paid thee euery farthing; because Christs satisfaction is his. And there is no iustice in it, that one debt should be twice paid, one sinne twice punished. Euery beleeuer by Faith is marryed vnto Christ as vnto an husband: and as in the Law, <hi>vxori lis non intenditur,</hi> no man layes his action against the wife, but the husband is answerable for the wife; so is Christ answerable for vs. And to him we put ouer the Law. If a beleeuer might be condemned, then eyther in the Legall Court, or in the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall: In the Legall hee cannot, because hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales from the sentence thereof to the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: In the Euangelicall he cannot, because there onely enquiry is made whether the appealer doe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:199:99"/> beleeue, which once appearing, hee is acquitted and dismissed. As wee see in the poore Publicanes example: being dragged forth into the Court of Iustice, and there cast, yet that sentence tooke no hold of him, because of his appeale to the Throne of Grace, where by Faith pleading nothing but Gods mercy, and his owne misery, Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mee a poore sinner, <hi>hee went away iustified, Luke</hi> 18.14. Oh singular comfort! A beleeuer may be, and is often accused by Sathan, by his owne Conscience, by the wicked World; for what innocency can stop clamorous mouthes? It is not said, Hee that beleeueth is <hi>not accused,</hi> but he is not <hi>condemned,</hi> though accused. And therefore hee may triumph with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? It is God that iustifies.</hi> Or as <hi>Augustine</hi> reades it interrogatiuely, Shall God that iustifies, or is in iustifying of vs? As if hee should say, if any might, it is God: But hee iustifies vs, and as long as hee iudicially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits vs, what matter is it what Sathan, or any other say? If the Iudge acquit the prisoner, what matter what the rest of his fellow-prisoners say? This sentence is that which will be a well-spring of comfort in the houre of death, when Sathan will be most fierce and fiery in pleading against vs, He that beleeueth in Christ is not, nor cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, because hauing satisfied Gods Iustice in Christ, he is already acquitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Let euery one looke to it, that hee doe indeede beleeue; else will it be worse with him in the Court of Mercy, then euer it would haue been
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:199:100"/> in the Court of Iustice: for now hee shall haue double damnation; first, that pronounced in the Law shall be ratified; and secondly, more shall be added, for abusing the Court of Mercy by a wrong appeale, and for laying claime to that sweet mercy which hee hath contemned. When men heare this doctrine, that the beleeuer is iustified, they vse to blesse themselues, and thinke they shall doe well, because they make no doubt but they beleeue: But if a prisoner knew that the Law would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, and that there is no way to saue him but his booke, hee would be sure that hee could reade, and would trye how hee could reade, and hee would euery day be taking paines to reade, and not, as the world doth in the matter of Faith, content himselfe with an idle imagination that he can reade: And yet sometimes another mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding saues the prisoner, but here the sinner must be saued onely by his owne Faith. Surely, Christ now the third time, in this short speech, vrging Faith, shewes that it is a farre other kinde of thing, then to imagine, and without ground to thinke that Christ dyed for vs. Therefore Faith being that whereby wee must be tryed in the case of the life and death of our soules eternally, it stands vs in hand to examine our selues of, and to inure and exercise our selues daily, in the serious practise of true Faith. What it is to beleeue is partly drawne from Courts of Iudgement:<note place="margin">What it is to beleeue, &amp; the practise of true Faith in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> A beleeuer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a man that hath a criminall capitall cause to be tryed in the Court of Iustice, where hee is sure to be cast, vnlesse hee can get some speciall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:199:100"/> Aduocate to pleade his cause, or get it remoued into some other more mercifull Court.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man would neuer goe to an Aduocate, nor labour the remouall of his cause, vnlesse hee saw his life otherwise gone: So hee that beleeues in Christ, must first see himselfe no better then a condemned man by the Law, and must be affected with the sense of this condemnation; that so hee may see in what neede hee stands of Christ to be his Aduocate. How doth the world then beleeue in Christ, who neuer apprehended seriously the condemning sentence of the Law, which should vrge them to Christ?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man in this case, condemned by the rigour of the Law to dye, would not thinke of vsing an Aduocate, or seeke to appeale to another Court, vnlesse hee saw some hope at least, of helpe that wayes. So here, hee that beleeues in Christ, must assure himselfe of the all-sufficiencie that is in him to saue him, as being the onely Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a man assured of the sufficiencie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of his Aduocate, and of the mercy of the Court whereto hee appeales, goes in humble wise lamenting his state vnto them, as hee stands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the other Court: So, hee that beleeues in Christ, hauing taken notice of Gods mercy in Christ, and in the Euangelicall Court, hee comes with a bleeding heart, and makes his moane, and raps and knockes, and cryes for reliefe, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned prisoner howles to the Iudge for mercy, and hee wholly casts himselfe vpon his Aduocate Christ, despayring in himselfe, and in all other
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:199:101"/> things besides. As the poore Publican, hauing heard the condemnation of the Law, was so asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with it, that he smote on the brest, and with a deiected countenance, presents himselfe prostrate before the Throne of Grace, and sayes, Lord, I haue nothing to trust to, but thy mercy; I am worthily condemned by the Law for my sinnes, but I appeale to thy mercy in the Gospell, <hi>Lord be mercifull to mee a sinner,</hi> conuicted and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This is the practise of true Faith: from which how farre are our vaine boasters? For it is no easie matter, when a man sees God as an angry Iudge condemning him, then to apprehend his mercy for forgiuenesse.</p>
                  <p>The second head of Doctrine, <hi>How this saluation is lost, and damnation incurred,</hi> is in the other clause; <hi>Hee that beleeueth not is already condemned.</hi>

Thou wilt say, Oh the day of Iudgement is not neare as yet; yea, but the sentence then to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, is already pronounced, and that which then is fully to be executed, is already in part begunne. The officers of damnation haue seized on thee, haue bound thee with their cords, and are drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thee to the gallowes, haue set thee on the ladder, put the rope on thy necke, and nothing is now wanting, but thy turning off the ladder.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Enuy not then the wicked their outward

If some Saint or Angell had beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto vs for a Sauiour, to trust in, wee might haue denyed Faith iustly: But now Gods owne naturall Sonne, God of God, is propounded, it cannot be but an horrible sinne not to beleeue in such a person, so sufficient, and so mighty to saue: for not to beleeue in him, is to disable him, and in effect to say hee is not able to saue vs, there is no such merit in his death, no such vertue in his obedience, and so indeede to deny his God-head.</p>

                  <p>Here followes the second reason, why the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer is condemned, because hee hates Christ and his Gospell, when offered to him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres his miserable estate of ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, before the knowledge of him. This reason is amplified by the weight of it, compared with the former; But <hi>this is that condemnation:</hi> as if hee had said, Hee deserues condemnation in the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but here is that which further encreases his damnation.</p>
                  <p>Now here Christ preuents a double Obiection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Obiection.</hi> Many neuer heard of the Name of Christ; Are they lyable to condemnation for not beleeuing in him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Hee that beleeueth not is condemned, for not beleeuing in so sufficient a Name as of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne of God, but yet so that this Name be named vnto them, that the light shine vnto him: <hi>This is that condemnation, that light is come into the world,</hi> that is, that Christ and his Gospell are reuealed clearely, as the light.</p>
                  <p>Negatiue infidelitie is no sinne.<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Christ here expounding the doctrine of the former <hi>Verse,</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:199:103"/> that the vnbeleeuer is condemned, restraines it to positiue infidelitie of those to whom the light doth shine. It would be iniustice in God to exact more of his creature then hee gaue: Now he neuer gaue any meanes of the knowledge of Christ, to such as neuer heard the sound of the Gospell. A Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman might as well expect and exact a crop of Wheat of his ground, hauing sowne no seed in it. It is replyed, that it is their owne fault, that God giues them not the meanes of knowledge. I answer, this proues it to be a punishment of sinne, as are all the miseries of this life, but yet no sinne: <hi>Paul</hi> is plaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The Gentiles sinning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law</hi> written, <hi>shall be iudged without that Law,</hi> euen by the Law of Nature, and not by the Gospell.</p>

The hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Infidelitie.</note>The hainousnesse of positiue infidelitie, when men haue meanes to beleeue in Christ, and yet neglect and refuse him: This is the condemning sinne: <hi>This is that condemnation,</hi> it brings condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with a witnesse, with a vengeance, sore and heauy condemnation. We haue examples, in the old World, reiecting <hi>Noah; the Preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> Euangelicall; in the Iewes before Christs comming, mocking the Prophets, <hi>till there was no remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. but specially in the fearfull desolation of the whole Nation of the Iewes since Christ, continuing, together with their vnbeliefe, to this day, <hi>Rom</hi> 11. <hi>They were cut off through their vnbeliefe.</hi> Incest is an odious sinne; but yet <hi>Herods</hi> contempt of the Gospell, in <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment, was aboue his Incest, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.20. <hi>Hee added this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:199:103"/> aboue all,</hi> euen aboue his Incest. Sodomie a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious abhomination, not to be named, but yet it shall be easier for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> at the day of Iudgement, then for <hi>Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> and such Cities as haue reiected Gods grace in the Gospell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. The Reasons of it are: First, all other sinnes haue this remedy prouided for them, <hi>The bloud of Christ,</hi> but no remedy for this; for this sinne is the refusing of the remedy. As long as a sicke man refuses Physicke, and will not endure the sight of the Physitian, what hope can there be of his life? His disease kils him not, but his obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate refusall of Physicke. Secondly, this sinne giues God the lye, a thing intollerable amongst men, and that in the weightiest matter that can be, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely confirmed with oath and Couenant. To giue a Prince the lye, though but in a trifle, a hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing, what then to giue it God swearing in the matter of our eternall saluation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Comfort to the repenting beleeuer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed for his sinnes against the Law: Faith in Christ takes away all our sinnes. Nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes vnder the Gospell, but the contempt of the Gospell, and the refusall of Gods mercy in Christ. No sinne here but infidelitie, as no righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse but Faith: Therefore, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. <hi>The Princes of Sodome</hi> are called to the bath of Christs bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Terrour to the reiecters of the Gospell, though liuing ciuilly, and not grosly breaking the Law: The world will thinke well of them, and they of themselues, they are no drunkards, swearers, murtherers, theeues, Sodomites: No, they are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:199:104"/> worse,<note place="margin">No damnation like that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie.</note> they despise the Gospell, and therefore shall haue farre heauier condemnation: farre better for them neuer to haue heard of Christ. There is no fall into hell like that, which is taken by a stumble at Christ. Oh fearefull must that condemnation be which is pronounced in the Court of Mercy! Wicked must hee be whom Mercy it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes. When Mercy condemnes, what would Iustice doe? Now euery vnbeleeuing impenitent wretch is condemned in the Court of Mercy and of the Gospell. Let not loose lewd people flatter themselues because of the Gospell. This is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their so heauy condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The Gospell is here compared to light; <hi>That light is come into the world.</hi>

                  <p>Wee both mistake in the darke, as a friend for a foe, a bush for a beast, and vpon this mistaking we are terrified. Thus was it in the darknesse of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and ignorance: Antichrist then not being discerned, was taken for a great God, and how was he feared? but now we see him to be a base worme, how do we scorne him and his <hi>bruta fulmina,</hi> which were more feared then the greatest Ordinance?

Thus before a mans enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, how are death, pouerty, afflictions, through

The light discouers the errour, and frees vs from the terrour. But of this Metaphor more in the 20. <hi>Verse.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, by shewing what the vnbeleeuers doe: Secondly, why they doe it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What they doe. <hi>They loue darknesse,</hi> (both Pharisaicall of errour, and Epicureall of sinne) <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the light,</hi> that is, Christ and his Gospell: As the Iewes preferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Christ, so they their miserable state of sinne and ignorance, before the state of grace in Christ.</p>
                  <p>By this see what the beleeuer does,<note place="margin">How true faith is practised.</note> and how true Faith is practised: Faith comes vnto Christ, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Sauiour, by comming to him, first, as vnto a light discouering our blindnesse and misery. So that the beleeuer must, first, see his darknesse; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hate it; thirdly, see helpe for it in Christ, as in a light; and fourthly, be in loue with this light, preferring it before all things in the world besides. In a word, the beleeuer apprehends Christ with an earnest loue of that sweetnesse that is in him, and with a perfect hatred of that miserable estate wherein he was being out of Christ: So <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. accounts his aduantages in Pharisaisme, as losse, as dirt and dung, in regard of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. It serues for the discouery of false faith: For, first, thou wilt not come to Christ as vnto a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:199:105"/> light, to see thy misery; thou wilt not see how blinde thou art, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. thou loathest not thine estate, nay, thou louest it, and when the Gospell comes to shew thee thy misery, with the remedy, thy bloud is vp: thou saist it is better to be as thou art and hast beene. Contentation in a mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, bruitish, and sottish ignorance is an euident signe of no faith, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.12. <hi>not beleeuing the truth,</hi> and <hi>taking pleasure in vnrighteousnesse,</hi> are ioyned together. So likewise when a man profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the truth, and yet heartily loueth some sinne, and that more then Christ; as <hi>Iudas</hi> loued his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, and his thirty pieces of siluer better then Christ; <hi>Herod</hi> loued <hi>Herodias</hi> and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest better then <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell; and so <hi>Demas</hi> the world; the <hi>Gadarens</hi> their hogges: for true Faith workes by Loue, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. yea, it apprehends Christ with a wonderfull extacie of affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.

This makes men of corrupt liues striue to blinde themselues, and to put out the very light of Nature, that they might sinne with greater liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. All men of an euill life are here conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of Infidelitie: Such will brag of Faith, and of comming to Christ, but <hi>hee that doth euill hates the light, and come not to it:</hi> Such men outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Gospell, but without all loue of it in hart; nay, they hate it, and loue vanities and errours. Oh how many hollow friends hath the Gospell! In preparation of heart they are Papists, Atheists, any thing rather then true Gospellers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Take we heede of giuing ouer our selues to worke iniquitie, if wee would continue in the truth: If thou shipwracke Conscience, Faith must needes be gone, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. Many lewd loose li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers will brag they will neuer forsake the Gospell; yes in heart they haue denyed it already, for their workes are euill, and the Gospell fauours them not. Louing therefore their sinne, they cannot but hate the Gospell that crosses and discountenances their sinnes: They are therefore a fit prey for Heresie.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:199:106"/> At this day what are they that reuolt to Popery, but the very out-casts and off-scourings of our Church, who first turned whoremongers and whores, and then Papists? They doe but now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with their mouthes, what they alwayes denyed and detested in heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. See how little heede is to be giuen to the iudgement of corrupt &amp; loose men in the matters of Religion, specially in such points as touch their liberty in sinne. Their affection to sinne darkens their vnderstanding: how should they see the light, when they hate it, and shut their eyes against it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 5. Many by this are conuinced to be of euill consciences and wicked men, howeuer their liues be not touched with scandall, as many a Papist and ciuill man. Why so? Because <hi>they hate the light,</hi> they loue darknesse and blindnesse better then the Gospell: And howsoeuer they pretend many causes why they cannot brooke the truth, as because of the nouelty, and that it is an enemy to policie, &amp;c. yet here is the true cause, <hi>Because their workes are euill. Ephes.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Paul</hi> shewes that the ignorance and errours of the Gentiles were from the hardnesse of their hearts. Their hearts were hardened by sinne, by long practising of it, and that was the cause they would not admit of the light offered.</p>
                  <p>That this is the reason why wicked men loue not the Gospell, because their workes are naught, hee proueth, <hi>Vers.</hi> 20. and 21.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the authoritie of a receiued sentence; <hi>Euery one that doth euill hates the light, and commeth
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:199:106"/> not to the light.</hi> Some would vnderstand this of the naturall light; and no doubt but Christ might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude this way, but yet the direct meaning seemes to be of the spirituall light: For neyther is the light of the Sunne able to discouer and detect all euill workes, neyther yet is it able to shew that any worke is wrought according to God; Both which are here said of this light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hateth.]</hi> Before it was said, <hi>loued darknesse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then light,</hi> now more plainely, that they hate the light: To shew, that when men outwardly professe the truth, and yet set their affections on things contrary to the Gospell, as their sinnes, they indeed hate it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commeth not.]</hi> Many wicked men come to the Church, and heare the Word, but not in Faith, not in Loue, not with a desire to see their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions discouered, and therefore in comming they come not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the effect of the Gospell, which is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, conuince, and reproue their sinnes: Now wicked men cannot endure that, and therefore not the Gospell that does this. Hee comes not to the light, lest his euill deedes should be conuinced, namely, to be euill, by that light.</p>
                  <p>Here are two things.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In shewing the remedy against sinne, by consequent it must needes shew vs our sinnes also.

                  <p n="2">2. In the infinitenesse of Christs sufferings is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the hainousnesse of our sinnes: For when in the Gospell wee see Gods owne Sonne so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled for our sinnes, (the most dreadfull spectacle of Gods anger against sinne that euer was) wee must needes therein, as in a glasse, see the vglinesse of our sinnes, that brought such tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon so sacred a person as Iesus Christ was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Gospell sets forth not onely the merit of Christs death for pardon, but also the efficacie of it for the mortification of sinne. And not onely the benefits of his life and death, but also the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for our imitation. An example farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing the Law, which requires onely the louing of our neighbour as our selues, whereas Christ lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs aboue himselfe. How can blacke be better discouered then when laid to white? how can our sinfull liues be better manifested, then when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the most holy life of Iesus Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Ministers must learne how to preach the Gospell, euen so that sinne may be reproued, and the bowels thereof laid naked, as in an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24.25. And thus should men desire to heare. Men are deceiued, when they thinke the Gospell should preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pleasing things vnto them: The Gospell
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:199:107"/> is a light, discouering the wickednesse of thine heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Wee that liue vnder the Gospell, must liue soberly, else the light thereof will shame vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11.12.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Here is a note to iudge of the true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell of Christ: It fauours no sinne, no it conuinces sinne, and detects it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Popery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that fauours grosse sinnes, as Aequiuocation, murthering of Princes, &amp;c. cannot be Christs Gospell.</p>

The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe here is true, <hi>Truth breedes hatred, flattery friendship.</hi> False religions flatter men in their sinnes, and therefore they are entertained: true Religion and the Gospell detects their sinnes, and therefore cannot be endured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Be not moued at the worlds hatred of the Gospell: Nay, hereby rather be assured, that the Gospel is Gods truth, which would cry downe mens sinnes, as preaching would haue done <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his trade; and therefore no maru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Ministers that are faithfull must looke for much hatred, because they preach the Gospell, which discouers mens wickednesse: Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> hated <hi>Michaiah.</hi> The Kings Chappell could not comport with <hi>Amos.</hi> It may be doubted Ministers open not the word aright when wicked men kicke not against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Yea, let euery Christian looke for hatred, for his conuersation is a light to manifest and make odious the wickednesse of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. The Gospell is held forth not onely in Ministers mouthes, but in all godly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans liues.</p>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:199:112"/> calling be measured out to him by Gods owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, then it is in vaine for you to grieue, that Christ is in the Ministry as well as I, and greater in his Ministry then I: for whatsoeuer hee hath this way, God from heauen disposes it to him: who then can make it lesse? And that smaller mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which I haue, is likewise by the same hand dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to mee: who then can make it more?</p>
                  <p>A notable remedy for enuy, to consider, that <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Is thine eye euill, because I am good?</hi> Are yee angry (saith <hi>Iohn</hi> in effect) that Christ baptizeth, and that with such successe, with such credit and esteeme? See with whom yee are angry; euen with heauen, whence the Spirit descended vpon Christ, to fit him for this calling. Doe all men follow him? But who sends them? Can hee helpe it? Doth hee entreat them? Doth hee seeke them, as Tradesmen doe Chapmen? Are all mens hearts in Gods hands, and doth not hee incline them to affect one man more then another?</p>
                  <p>It teaches vs not onely, not to enuy, but to loue, <label type="milestone">

Heauen smiles on them, and shall any on earth looke awry on them? Doth God set the seales of his Loue vpon them, and shall wee of our Malice?</p>

Many a man as great in pride, as hee is small in desert, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be in account &amp; request as well as others, what adoe keepes he? hauing but a wooden head, and a leaden heart, yet hee will helpe it out with a brasen face, in an audacious masterlinesse, and with a golden hand, with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> beare downe all with large proffers: As though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary were here true, to that which Christ sayes, That a man can receiue nothing vnlesse it be giuen him from beneath, out of the bowels of the earth, where is the veyne of gold and siluer.

As long as <hi>Rahel</hi> iangled with her husband, and with her sister, in her barrennesse, shee could get nothing, till shee fell to humble and repenting prayers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.22. Though some of meaner parts then thy selfe, haue in the same calling wherein thou art,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:199:113"/> greater successe then thy selfe, yet here is that which must hush all; not onely mens gifts, but the successe of their gifts is measured in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. And God sees iust cause to grace with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse lesser gifts sometimes aboue the greater, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps because hee sees greater sinceritie in the lesse; which as it made the Widdowes mite heauier then the talents of the Pharisees, so likewise it makes the Badgers skinnes and Goates hayre of meaner Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, more pretious and acceptable in the Lords Temple, then the Iewels and pretious stones of more learned ones. Let it not trouble thee that thou art no greater, no more respected, thou hast and shalt haue the measure God hath mete out for thee. So <hi>Iohn</hi> here satisfies his Disciple repining, both that they wanted, and another had. If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue, God hath measured, and hee measuring hee cannot but haue.

All considered especially, for so shall wee finde Christs loue to be pure loue. Men marry commonly either for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or person, or wealth, or parentage. Beauty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten swayes mens affection, where nought else: And where beauty and person are wanting, yet wealth and riches will mend all; These are strong incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and attractiues of mens affections: Yet where all these are wanting, yet sometimes good manners, education, nurture, and grace are meanes to make women gracious in mens eies, and these are spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to wooe for them: All these, or some of these commonly are the caement of mens affections. But behold, Christs loue is pure loue, we had nothing in vs to moue him, or winne, or wooe him, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person, parts, portion, beauty or grace in vs to draw his affections, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will marry thee vnto mee in mercy and compassion.</hi> His owne mercy was our spokesman; his compassion of our woe wooed for vs. Not our parentage, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3. not our wealth or credit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5. not our beauty.

Not for our beauty, for wee were <hi>blinde, Reu.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>bloudy, Ezek.</hi> 16.6. The Papists would haue vs come like craking dames, that vse to vpbraid their husbands with their great portion, and would not haue vs make our selues so ill-fauoured and poore as wee doe: they would finde somewhat in man that might make him gracious in Christs eyes: But this is to derogate from Christs loue; the more merit wee plead, the more wee diminish his loue.</p>

This loue must be in two things: First, in cleauing so to him that we forsake him not in any afflictions; but to haue our hearts as much enamoured vpon him, when wee see the crowne of thornes on his head, as when we see the crowne of glory: Sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, imprisonment, disgrace, makes a good wife loue her husband more dearely. It is but a strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets tricke to leaue her husband in his distresse when he most needes her. Secondly, in giuing our whole hearts so to Christ, as that wee admit no strange loue to haue a share with him. It is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish after the marriage couenant, for a woman to set her heart vpon another man; such a woman would no man endure: let vs not doe so. In bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme wee sealed the couenant of marriage, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:199:121"/> therfore we forswore and abiured all other strange loues, the loue of the world, sathan, and the flesh. Now looke we to it that we be faithfull in our loue to him, and that we wed not our affections to the world. A monstrous thing to see a woman mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to two husbands at once: and howeuer it were sometime tolerated that a man had two, or moe wiues; yet neuer finde we that any woman had two husbands at once. Since then wee are Christs wife, take we heede we play not false with him, that we goe not a whoring after the world, the flesh, and our lusts. If we set our loues vpon the world, our affections vpon the earth, we are adulteresses: Adultery by Gods law is death; take heede then of spirituall adultery. And this indeede doth discouer many to be guilty of spirituall adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that like the wanton widdowes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>haue broken their first faith:</hi> that looke as naughty-packs vse to hide all their knauery vnder the colour of marriage; so now a dayes many vitious and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous persons that haue wedded their hearts to the world yet <hi>wipe their mouthes,</hi> with the whore, and say, <hi>what haue I done?</hi> Though their hearts are vpon their lusts, vpon the world, yet they beleeue in Christ, and hope to be saued by Christ, and they are Christs: And so Christ is made a stale and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for their spirituall adultries. Deceiue not thy selfe thou couetous person, thou art none of Christs; thou art an adultresse, thou art naught, with the world, and prostitutest thine heart to it, and now wouldest thou couer it with Christ: So for the voluptuous person, Christ will not owne,

                  <p n="1">1. They thorowly know Christ themselues. What wise man will speake for a stranger hee knowes not, and commend him for a husband to a woman.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Knowing him, that they be able to speake of him, and to set out his worth to the full. A checke to dumbe ministers: A dumbe man is no fit spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the matter of marriage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they speake wisely and to the purpose. They are foolish spokesmen that speake so idly and absurdly, that they disswade and discourage in speaking. Many Preachers by their vaine and idle pratling euen driue men away from Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That they speake earnestly and seriously: for a spokesman in marriage is to worke vpon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:199:123"/> And so are Ministers not onely to worke vpon the vnderstanding, but specially vpon the affections. And therefore they must at no hand be cold.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That they speake faithfully. Not to speake one word for Christ, and two for themselues: not to be Christs corriuals, as many that seeke to gaine the Church to themselues, and to interest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in her heart. Treachery in a spokesman is hatefull.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. They receiue the Ministers with all respect, as a meaner woman would doe messengers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from some great King, to treate about mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with her. A priuiledge to be a Kings Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour in any businesse, but specially about his owne marriage: What a shame is this that so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Embassadours, sent from the great King of heauen, to treate with vs poore beggers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning marriage, bringing so sweet a message, so rich tokens as are the body and bloud of his owne Sonne, should not be accepted? This disgrace must needes redound to the Lord himselfe. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the spokesman, despiseth the Bridegroome. But alas, this office of match-making is a thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse office, euen in this spirituall marriage, as well as in the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In hearing the Minister, that they marke and giue good eare, as a maide will doe, when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of marriage is broken vnto her, and to labour in hearing, to come to a thorow knowledge of this Christ, that is tendred as an husband to them: for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:199:124"/> this is required in marriage. <hi>Error personae</hi> makes a nullitie: Thou that art wholy ignorant of Christ, how canst thou thinke that hee is thine husband?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When they are wrought vpon in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, not to gaine-say. A foolish woman were shee that would say to a mighty King seeking and suing to her. One would thinke a King should haue an easie suite, seeking a begger for his wife. Christ seekes vs worse then beggers, and yet what a deale of wooing, what perswasions, and intreaties must his Ministers vse, and yet this marriage will not be hearkened after? At death they will beginne to hearken to it. Indeed sometimes in the other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages men and women will match on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: looke not to doe so here. Marriages are not made vp rashly, but there must be some time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. First, there must be a contract, and there vses to be a space of time betwixt contract and marriage.

Thou hast giuen mee more ioy of heart in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of thy peoples faith, then they haue had in the increase of their Tithes, and in the pluralitie of their Liuings.</p>
                  <p>And if it be such a ioy to see but the contract betweene Christ and some few of his people in this life, what then to see the solemnization of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage it selfe in the life to come?</p>

                  <p>A fourth Argument. The Argument is drawne from the necessitie both of <hi>Iohns</hi> decreasing, and Christs increasing state. It must be so, God hath so appoynted; therefore it is in vaine to repine: His increase must be by my decrease.</p>
                  <p>God sets limits to the increasings of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> God sets li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasings of his Ministers.</note> and when growne to their height, hee will oftentimes take them downe. Sometimes by ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing more glorious instruments then themselues, as <hi>Christ</hi> after <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> after <hi>Luther.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the worlds vnthankfulnesse and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, as in <hi>Iohns</hi> case also, <hi>Yee reioyced in his light for a season.</hi> Sometimes by the rage of Tyrants, as in <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment and death. God doth this, first, lest his Ministers should be hurt with too much glory: secondly, lest his owne glory should
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:199:125"/> be hindred, as here <hi>Iohns</hi> increasings continuing, would haue obscured Christ: and therefore hee must decrease, that Christ may increase.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> To teach vs patience and ioy in our decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, when wee see Christ increasing in and by them. All must be subiected to Gods glory. As long as <hi>Iohns</hi> increasing furthered his glory, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: But when his greatnesse would haue been a stumbling blocke in Christs way, then is hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned and beheaded. And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as well to decrease, as to increase; for his increasings and decreasings tend all to one end, to the furtherance of the Gospell. So that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, what matters it, thinkes hee, though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. As that good Bishop dying, <hi>Modo me mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riente floreat Ecclesia,</hi> though he died, if the Church flourished, his care was ouer. Many can like well increasing, rising, and flourishing, but to decay, and come downe as fast, this goes hard: But with <hi>Iohn</hi> we must be content as well with our crosses, our waues, our ebbs and diminutions, as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and increasings, thinking the one as good for vs as the other: knowing that God is glorified in the one as well as in the other. How should this comfort Gods Ministers in their decreasings, when forsaken, when restrayned. Their decrease is not the Gospels. Their imprisonment is not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels restraint, but inlargement, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.13.14.</p>

Of such a mettall is mans soule, dull, slow, heauy, impure, and grosse, as farre distant from heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, as the earth it selfe is from heauen. The reason is set downe: Because man <hi>is of the earth.

                  <p>Euery mans speech naturally is from the earth. Though <hi>the lips of the righteous be as fined siluer. Pro.</hi> 10.20. yet that is by grace, by nature they are filthy drosse. So <hi>Isaiah</hi> speakes of himselfe, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. that he was <hi>a man of polluted lips:</hi> And hence that confession of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Wee prophecie in part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Not to be offended if Ministers, and that in the Pulpit, speake from the earth, and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with earthly passions; for of themselues they can speake no otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Rest not in the words of any Minister, but to

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let Ministers then labour to haue their tongues refined, and touched with a coale from the Altar. They were not earthly, but fiery tongues, that sat vpon the Apostles: else though they spake of heauenly things, yet it will be but in an earthly manner. Like that rediculous Actor, that crying, <hi>Oh heauen,</hi> pointed with his finger to the earth. And there will be no <hi>comparing of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things with spirituall things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. that is, spirituall matter with spirituall words. Neither must Ministers onely labour to haue the earthly fore-skin of their lips circumcised, but all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: else no speaking the language of <hi>Canaan.

                  <p>The second part of the dissimilitude followes, concerning Christ. That he being from heauen <hi>speakes that which he hath seene and heard;</hi> namely, in heauen. <hi>Seene,</hi> in regard of the euidence of truth: <hi>Heard,</hi> in regard of the order of knowledge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the second person receiues with his Essence all things from the Father: therefore <hi>Hearing</hi> vsed to expresse it; because in hearing something pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from another to vs. <hi>Zanchie</hi> referres <hi>seeing</hi> to the God-head, and <hi>hearing</hi> to the man-hood.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, they thought too many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; <hi>Iohn</hi> thinkes too few. Secondly, <hi>Iohn</hi> saw that all Christs followers were not sound at the heart, and therefore did not with a true faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his testimony. Among the professours of the Gospell, so few true friends are there of the Gospell. Let this make vs search our hearts.</p>
                  <p>This also teaches vs not to measure truth by multitude; which as Antiquity, is but a cypher in Diuinitie, and hath no value in it selfe.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>A second Argument to moue to faith in Christ, from the honour that comes to God thereby: The glory of his truth is giuen him. A man doth as it were subscribe to Gods word, and sets his seale to it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. The Papists say it is arrogancy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption by a speciall Faith, to apply the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to our selues. But here wee see it is a notable glorifying of God. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Abraham was strengthned in the Faith, and gaue glory to God.</hi> So that not to beleeue, is horrible presumption; for then we presume to giue him the lye; for he that doth not in speciall apply the promise vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, doth not in heart and very deede beleeue the generall promise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This must encourage vs to beleeue. God is more glorified by the faith of a repenting sinner, then by the perfect obedience of a man perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sanctified; for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. his power, and so his glory, is perfected in mans infirmity; which makes a man deny himselfe, and by Faith wholly to cast himselfe vpon Gods mercy. Whereas in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of obedience, a man doth not so much as goe out of himselfe. And as God is thus glorified in our Faith, so are we honoured, while such poore wormes as wee, are called to the <hi>sealing</hi> of Gods truth.</p>

                  <p>A third argument, to beleeue in Christ, from that sufficiency which is in him to be a Sauiour, and so to giue full content to our hearts resting on him. His words and doctrines are most true; The very <hi>words of God</hi> himselfe. His gifts, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces are most rich and ample. <hi>He hath not the spirit giuen him by measure:</hi> The Fathers loue of him is most entyre, and the acceptation of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is such, that <hi>he hath giuen him all things</hi> that his people can stand in neede of. Is not therefore Iesus Christ worthy to be beleeued in? Is he not euery way abundantly furnished to be our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, able to instruct vs in the truth, speaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gods Oracles? able to sanctifie vs with the truth, hauing such an vnmeasurable measure of the Spirit? Able to reconcile vs to the Father being in such surpassing grace with him himselfe? Able to helpe vs in any of our wants; yea, and in the end to possesse vs of eternall life, hauing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:199:130"/> receiued all things from his father any way neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs.</p>
                  <p>In generall, marke how Faith apprehends Christ,<note place="margin">How Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Christ.</note> namely, as he is described here to vs, with a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all these his sufficiences. And therefore the faith of the common people, who know not, nor thinke not of these things, is an idle fancy. True faith in Christ must see that in him, which may be a proppe for her to rest vpon.</p>
                  <p>For the words more particulary, <hi>For he whom God.</hi> As they are a reason, together with that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, to perswade to the receiuing of Christ (the maine drift of the Baptists speach) so may they also be a reason to confirme the sentence immediately going before, thus; Christ speakes nothing but the words of God, therefore he that receiueth his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, acknowledgeth the truth of God.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What speciall thing is spoken here of Christ? Is any more said of him then others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, for first. A speciall sending is here meant, namely to be manifested in the flesh, and therein to performe the office of a mediatour.

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How are these words to be vnderstood of Christ?</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> They are true of him, as the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the Father hath not giuen him the spirit by measure, because he hath giuen him the whole spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for the same spirit that is in the Father, is in the Sonne, whence he is said to proceede from both. But it seemes that <hi>Iohn</hi> here speakes of him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and so also his manhood is included. God doth not giue his spirit, that is, his gifts and graces to him sparingly, as if he measured them; no, he neuer stands measuring, but powers them on with a full hand, abundantly.</p>

Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30.

For triall whether thou beleeue in Christ or no: For then eternall life is begunne in thee, namely, the life of grace, which is an imperfect life of glory, as the life of glory is the perfect life of grace. Faith is well called liuely, because vniting a man to Christ the head and fountaine of life, it drawes life thence vnto him, euen the same life that is in Christ, a spirituall, heauenly, eternall life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I liue by the faith of the Sonne of God, yet I liue not, but Christ in mee.</hi> Many brag of Faith, and yet no life of grace appeares in them, nor actions of life.

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Comfort against the feare of finall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie. It is not an eternall life which is subiect to death. Now the true beleeuer already hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and therefore cannot wholy fall away from grace: for then this life should dye.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Comfort in all our troubles here, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.1. in regard of our right to, and possession of, yea, and in part fruition also of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 5. Comfort against the feare of death. Death may spoyle thee of thy naturall life, not thy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, for that is eternall. Be not dismaied, as a man thou art mortall, as a beleeuer thou art immortall. In thy selfe thou hast death, in Christ life. Thou art weake, sickely, decayed and aged, and hast one foot in the graue: what of all this, when beleeuing in Christ, besides that, thine head is there already, thou hast also one foot in heauen.</p>
                  <p>This benefit of Faith is set forth by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurt of vnbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that obeyeth not the Sonne.]</hi> Namely, in the precept of Faith: for <hi>this is the commandement of God, that yee beleeue in the name of his Sonne Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23. This must make vs striue against
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:199:133"/> our doubtings, for in them wee are disobedient to Christ. This obedience to the Sonne may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extended to the obedience of our liues, and not obeying him so, is well opposed to beleeuing, to shew that Faith and Obedience alwayes goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Faith in Christ as a Sauiour, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ as a Lord, and that they who want the latter haue not the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall not see life.]</hi> That is, in himselfe, though in hell hee shall see it in others to his greater griefe, as the rich man saw <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16. This is the losse, &amp; an heauy losse, <hi>to see Abraham and Isaac, &amp;c. in the kingdome of God, and our selues thrust out of doores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the wrath of God abides on him.]</hi> Here is the cause of the losse. Eternall life consists in beholding the sweet face of God, and the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. That a man may enioy Gods fauour, his anger must first be remoued: Now Christ onely remoues Gods anger from vs. The vnbeleeuer therefore being out of Christ, hath Gods anger still abiding on him, and so is vncapable of his fauour, and so excluded from happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Onely vnbeliefe procures rest and setled abode to Gods anger. Gods anger makes it nest,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Doct.</note> and takes vp its rest onely vpon the head of vnbeliefe. Though his anger rise vp against all other sinnes, yet it may be remoued by Faith in Christ. This is comfortable to the poore sinner, when in the conscience of his many other sinnes discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet he findes his heart fastning on Christ. And this is heauy to all ciuill, morall iusticiaries, when
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:199:134"/> for all their glorious vertues, they feele no faith in Christ, much more to prophane and proud sinners, when to the lesser weights of their other sinnes, they lay vpon themselues this mil-stone of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, to keepe Gods anger from euer rising off them. An vnbeleeuer seales Gods anger vpon himselfe, as the Iewes did Christs sepulchre with a great stone.</p>

If thou wouldest finde the spring of Christs Merit, of Christs Spirit, in thine heart, thou must digge deepe with the Spade of the Law, searching, and trying, and breaking vp thine heart. So Christ in this place, seeking for this spring in this same dry Desert of the Samaritanes heart, hee is faine to digge and delue, to conuince her of her sinnes, and to humble her in the sight of them, as we shall see afterward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Spring-water</hi> may be deepe, but yet still, and it runnes with a still murmure, not with the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a violent torrent: The grace of God in his Children makes not such a noyse, as the shewes doe in hypocrites.

It is no cisterne-water, no pond-water, no puddle-water, of our owne mirie merits that can slake our thirst, when scorched with the sence of Gods wrath. And yet the Church of Rome giues vs such swash; dealing with the thirsty Christian, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> with thirsty Christ; giuing vs wine mingled with gall: Christs merits mingled with our owne. This is to trouble the Fountaine with filth and mudde; nay, this is <hi>to forsake the Fountaine of liuing Waters, and to dig pits that will hold no water, Ier.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Spring water</hi> holdes out, will not be drawne dry, no not in the greatest heate of Summer.

Here is the triall of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:199:142"/> our knowledge. It is but a vaine and idle dreaming knowledge, which prouokes vs not to prayer. If our eyes were opened to see Christ, so would our mouthes also cry after him.

This is the reason that so few prayers, and harty desires for grace: Men know not the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of grace. The hardnesse of their heart in not being affected with that sweetenesse which is in Christ, is from the blindenesse of their minde.</p>
                  <p>And this is the first Argument, from the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> that is in Christ; yea, but though Christ be so precious a blessing; yet if a matter of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary difficulty to get him, this might discourage, therfore he ads a second argument, to prouoke her thirst, from the easinesse of obtaining him, euen by asking onely. <hi>Thou wouldest haue asked of him, and he would haue giuen thee the liuing water.</hi> Withall here is a secret twitting of the woman, with her vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in denying him water: As if he had said, though thou denyest me a little water, asking thee; yet I would haue dealt otherwise with thee, if thou hadst asked me spirituall water.</p>

                     <hi>The Vse.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Saints doe perseuer.</note> Here is a large comfort for the Saints. First, they can neuer fall away wholy, and returne to their former drought. Those few drops which flow from the fountaine Christ to them, proue a fountaine in them. If a man take a dish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of water out of a fountaine, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another place, it will not proue a fountaine, but quickely consume: But here the water of the fountaine becomes a fountaine. Looke how many measures of water are communicated to the Elect, so many fountaines. Now fountaines cannot be exhausted: Though the riuers flowing from the fountaine may be brought to a low ebbe, and in some places there may be great shelues, yet there will be water at the head of the riuer, in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. And what though thou haue but a little grace, and thou see many that seeme to haue more, to turne bankerupts: So did many rich men, that had more oyle, more meale, then the <hi>Sareptan</hi> wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, pirish for famine when shee did not, because there was a fresh spring in her little cruise, and in her little barrell. And so howsoeuer the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brooks of hypocrites faile in summers drought, yet the little fountaine waters of Gods children still hold out: Whence it is, that <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Paul</hi> saies, that God hath shed his grace <hi>richly</hi> vpon vs, (and yet wee complaine of great scarsity) because how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be but a little, as a fountaine is but small, yet still there is a fresh succession, a continuall spring alwayes running. And in this regard the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:199:146"/> fountaine hath more water then the torrent. But the Popish Interpreters would gladly elude this place: Here is shewed, say they, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this water and the other, in regard of the waters themselues; that one may be consumed with the heat of the stomacke, and so cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our thirst from returning, the other is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and so of it selfe is able to quench thirst for euer, if we let it alone, and cast it not vp againe. <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ doth not onely shew what this water can doe, but what it shall, and must needes doe: <hi>Hee shall neuer thirst, and it shall be a fountaine of water, springing vnto euerlasting life.</hi> Let the Diuell giue Gods childe neuer such vomits, hee may cast vp some of the water, but still the fountaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines springing at the heart, the fountaine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vomited vp. Farther, to take that they say of the nature of the waters: what difference should there be twixt these two natures, if as the naturall heate of our stomackes preuailes against temporall waters, so the vnnaturall heat of our corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence should likewise preuaile against all the spirituall water? For what else is the casting vp of the water? No, the words of Christ are too cleare so to be eluded; <hi>The water shall be a fountaine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes springing to eternall life:</hi> which speach were not true, if it might be cast vp after it is drunke. In conduits and conueyances of waters, looke how farre the water descends, so farre it ascends: Now this water it descends from heauen, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore it will returne againe. As the water in the Rocke followed the Israelites into the Land
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:199:146"/> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> so this water that comes from Christ, figured by that Rocke, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. followes vs to the heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> during our peregrination here in this world. Grace cannot end in shame; it cannot end but in glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is further comfort for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are scorched in conscience with the sense of Gods wrath, and are as the parched ground. As wee say in our ordinary Prouerbe, That it is good going on foot with an horse in ones hand; so good thirsting with a fountaine of water in ones brest. Hee shall not thirst so, but that this water shall be a fountaine, springing and sending forth water to relieue his thirst. <hi>Diues</hi> in hell thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, could not haue one drop of this water vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed him: But the godly in that hell they are in often vpon earth, they haue. It is a terrible thing this thirst. Christ that here forgot his naturall thirst, pained yet with this thirst on the Crosse, cryed out, <hi>I thirst:</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> that ouercame the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the other thirst, pouring the water vpon the ground, how miserably complaines hee, vexed with this thirst? <hi>Psal.</hi> 38 and 32. and 143.6. Yet here is comfort in this misery: a fountaine of liuing water springs in our hearts, to refresh, to refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and reuiue vs, so that wee shall neuer dye of this thrist.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is a tryall of the grace of God in vs: For it is a fountaine springing and ejaculating his water vpward, mounting and aspiring to heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:199:147"/> If the streame of thine affections runne head-long downeward, the grace of God is not in thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is instruction what to do in our drought, to runne to Christ, to cry to him for this water: Hee is both the water, and the giuer of the water; <hi>The water which I shall giue.</hi> As <hi>Sisera</hi> to <hi>Iael, Giue mee drinke, for I am thirsty,</hi> so say wee to Christ, when scalded and tyred with the heat of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing consciences.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Grace of God being compared to fountaine water, it must teach vs carefully to preserue the same, that it be not troubled nor poysoned, that wee suffer not Sathan, as once the Philistims did to <hi>Isaacks</hi> Wels, to stop them vp with his mud. The Romanes were carefull by Lawes to maintaine and fence their fountaines: Greater should our care be to preserue this fountaine from all annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to looke that the streame runne freely and clearely. Perhaps Sathans temptations will damme it vp for a while, but we must so resist, that at length getting the victory, it may flow so much the more violently.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the two first Arguments, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke this womans thirst. The third now followeth, from her owne need of it.

For Christ sought rather to make her a Christian then a Iew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Woman beleeue me.]</hi> This as a serious preface, wherein Christ vseth that priuiledge of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetship, acknowledged by her. For Prophets haue right to be beleeued, being guided by an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able assistance of the spirit: But now no Minister to be beleeued on his bare word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The houre commeth.]</hi> Here three questions may be asked.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Did the Samaritans worship the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For Christs words seeme to imply so much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In their owne intention they worshipped the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and that was
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:199:151"/> the Father: But indeede they did not; for Christ in the next verse, in a kinde of reuocation of that he might seeme to speake in this verse, saies, <hi>ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, ye know not what.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why doth he say, <hi>ye shall worship the Father,</hi> rather then God? And so afterward. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> To shew vs how God is to be worshipped. First, not as an absolute God, but in the Trinity of persons, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. Now when the Father is named, the two other persons are included, all subsisting together in one and the same God-head; we are to call vpon the name of God the Father, in the name of his Sonne, by the assistance, and motion of his holy Spirit. Here then all the deuotion of Turkes, and Iewes, yea, and of many of our common people is marred, that know not the doctrine of the Trinity. Secondly, As a Father louing vs as sonnes, and so we should come to him boldly, as sonnes, crying <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Thou that art a sonne the darling of thy father, neuer feare to come into his presence: Neuer seeke to a straunger to be thine intercessour. Here we see that the Papists, and all such as want the assurance of Gods loue to them in Christ, cannot truely pray, for they cannot say the first word of prayer; <hi>O our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth Christ say his Father will be worshipped no longer in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when God sayes. <hi>Ps.</hi> 132. It is his rest for euer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, especially of the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Church. So when Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, <hi>Gen</hi> 17.46. is said to be an euerlasting
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:199:152"/> couenant, it is true, especially in regard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumcision of the heart. It is true also of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the type, in a limited sence; as when we say, I giue thee this for euer, that is; during life. So <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> circumcision, legall worship, were for euer, that is, till Christ, and the beginning of the new world in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctr.</note>In the new Testament, distinction of place for Gods worship is taken away. In the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God reuealed himselfe in the Temple, ouer the Mercy-seate.

                  <p>Here the first question that might be made out of the former answere is met with, and it is this: Though both these worships must be shortly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, yet while they continue, one onely is the right: I would know then which that is.

Their religion which was grosser at first, was now refined by <hi>Menasses</hi> a Iew, a Priest, that in the time of King <hi>Alexander</hi> made a defection to him, and brought
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:199:152"/> many Iewes with him. <hi>Origen</hi> also writes, that they receiued the fiue bookes of <hi>Moses;</hi> and yet because they conceiued not aright of God, nor worshipped him in the place appointed; but had a new Temple, and a Priest-hood of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising; they are said, <hi>to worship they know not what,</hi> that is, a fansie, an idoll of their owne braine, not the true God.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. The <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> then worship an idoll, because God is conceiued out of Christ. Now there is no such God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Papists worship an idoll: For first they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue amisse of God, as though his presence were
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:199:153"/> tyed to images in speciall manner: but alas there is no such God. They conceiue amisse of Christ, as though he were held in the hands of the Priest, after the words of consecration: but there is no such Christ. They worship therfore a God, and a Christ, of their owne deuising. Besides, they haue like the <hi>Samaritans</hi> new rites, new formes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which God neuer commanded: All their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion consists of new deuised rites and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And the sacrifice of the Masse, the very marrow of their Religion, is hewne out of the same rocke. They may pretend good meanings, and intentions to God, but <hi>loue is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> and <hi>loue reioyceth in the truth.</hi> God findeth fault with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that they had set vp their posts by his posts, and their thresholds by his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.8. <hi>Socrates</hi> might haue taught them, that God is to be worshipped, as he himselfe will. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heathen <hi>Romanes</hi> knew thus much, as <hi>Austen</hi> hath obserued; when therfore they refused the God of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> who yet intertayned the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of other Gods, because they knew that if they worshipped him not in that manner he would be worshipped, they should not worship him at all, but a fained deuise of their owne: Now they could not worship him according to his owne will, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they put away all other gods, and that they were loath to doe, fearing more harme by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of these many false gods, then hoping for good, by the good will of the one true God, as <hi>Austen</hi> saies.</p>
                  <p>Our ignorant multitude worships an idoll, they
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:199:153"/> know not what: for they conceiue of God and his worship, according to their owne silly addle heads, not out of the word of God. Their God is made all of Mercy, and no Iustice. Their worship of God is their good meaning, and their good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and mumbling ouer the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Creede, the Lords Prayer, without all vnderstanding. In sickenesse and danger of death, a prayer-booke is brought forth, and something out of that must be read, though perhaps nothing to the present purpose. Alas what kinde of God is this of theirs, that can be charmed with a few words? What strange conceits haue these silly people of God? A man may well write vpon all their deuotions, that which was written vpon the altar at <hi>Athens, To the vnknowne God.</hi> God igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly worshipped, according to the direction of mens blinde and braine-sicke heads, is an idoll, and no God.</p>

And thus <hi>Spirit</hi> is opposed to the earthly, and carnall worship of the Iewes, which stood in meates, and drinkes, and diuers washings, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rites, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1.10. and 7.16. <hi>And Truth.]</hi> Truth being taken for sincerity, is the same with Spirit in the first sense, or not much differing; but further it is here opposed. First, to the Iewish rites that stood in figures, and shadowes: but now the worship of Christians stands in the <hi>truth</hi> of those
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:199:155"/> figures, as in mortification, and denyall of our selues, &amp;c. figured by the legall Sacrifices, <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.1. This is the reasonable seruice of God, and as here Christ speakes, the spirituall seruice. Secondly, it is opposed to the voluntary worship of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, deuised by their owne lying braynes, and so was a false worship, not onely wanting the <hi>truth</hi> of a good heart, for the manner, but the <hi>truth</hi> of Gods word for the matter of the worship.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The true worshippers worshipped God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> in the old Testament, in this sense.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The former of these Ceremonie are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and serue liuely to expresse the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our hearts, and so belong to the worship that is in spirit: for the worship in spirit is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inward affection, but all such outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations in action, as a sound affection must needes vent it selfe by. The latter are instituted by God himselfe, but they are so few, Bread and Wine in the Supper, Water in Baptisme, that in
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:199:156"/> comparison it may seeme meerely spirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to the Iewish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Vse.</hi> 1. The Popish worship is here marked out for a false worship. When Christ here saies, <hi>the true worshippers shall worship in spirit, &amp;c.</hi> hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, there should be false worshippers, that should worship otherwise: and it seemes probable, that hee euen aymed at them in these words. Surely he hath notably discouered them; for their worship is as ceremonious, as pompous, and outwardly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as euer was the Iewish; meerely sensuall, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the eyes with their golden Images and costly furniture, with their richly arayed Priests, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leling the Iewish; pleasing the eares with their musicke; the smell with their incense and perfumes. Their whole Masse, what is it but a masse of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? They reuiue, and rake out of the ashes, the Iewish and Paganish Rites. <hi>Paul</hi> shewes, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. that the Iewes were but Children when their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were in vse: The Popish religion then is but a babish, and an Apish reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But now the little finger of Popish ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies is farre heauier to the Church then the whole body was in <hi>Augustines</hi> time. Well, if this be a note of the true worship, that it shall not be as the Iewish, all Ceremonie, but all Spirit, and as little Ceremony as may be, surely the Popish wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, a fardell of Ceremonies, and nought else, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:199:156"/> be the true. As in men, the lesse body the more spirit commonly, so in Gods seruice, the greater the bulke of bodily Ceremonies, the lesse spirit of true Deuotion. See <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.16. The true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers shall so heede the spirituall worship, that they shall forget the Arke, that is, all those outward Ceremonies; but how haue the Papists forgotten them, that haue reuiued them? And <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.5. the false hypocrites are brought in, crowing ouer the true worshippers, glorying in their outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious worship. Nay, they are here yet further discouered: for the true worshippers <hi>worship the Father.</hi> Wee heare of none else they are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But the Popish worship directs vs to Saints, and to Angels. Further, the matter of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship must be in the word, and according to the truth thereof: But the Popish worship is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, deuised, Samaritan worship, and so is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor in <hi>Truth.</hi>

Many talke of their seruing of God, but few know what it meanes: God is not to be serued only morning &amp; euening with a few words, but all the day long, as <hi>Zechary</hi> saies, <hi>all the daies of our liues:</hi> yea, all the houres; <hi>for this is the whole duty of man to feare God, and keepe his commandements, Eccl.</hi> 12. There must be nothing done by man, but it must
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:199:157"/> belong to this: for euen in our eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wee must glorifie God; and no glorifying of God, but by obedience, and obedience is better then sacrifice; it is the highest seruice. Hee that doth not thus serue God, doth but mocke him in saying of his prayers, &amp; comming to the Church, and deales with him as <hi>Prometheus</hi> with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in giuing him bones couered ouer with skinne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing eate vp all the meat. It is the Diuell that men commonly serue, when their affections, motions, and actions are set on sinne. Could wee endure to haue one glauer on vs with faire words, and giue vs Court-holy-water, and inwardly to conspire with our enemies against vs? And yet thus doe we deale with God, and wee thinke wee serue him trimly to. As the common drunkard, swearer, adulterer, &amp;c. thinke when they haue beene at Church, they haue serued God sufficiently, though all the weeke long they haue serued the Diuell in the stewes, and in the Ale-house.</p>

These two things must be conioyned, <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth:</hi> There must be a <hi>true matter</hi> of worship, grounded on the Word; it must be no deuised worship: There must be also a <hi>true manner</hi> of worship; it must be done with the very spirit of the minde, and come from the very heart-roote: it must be no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall complementing worship.

                     <note place="margin">Motions in Gods seruice must be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note>5. It is not enough that in Gods worship, we feele in our selues inward motions and affections, but these motions must be spirituall, stirred vp in vs by the Spirit of God, or else wee cannot truly be said to worship in spirit. This makes, first, against all vnregenerate persons, all hypocrites, and temporary beleeuers: Though they may feele some flashings in their deuotions otherwhiles, yet these motions are not from the sanctifying Spirit of God, the Spirit of Prayer, <hi>Iude</hi> 20. <hi>praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the holy Ghost.</hi> Secondly, it makes against all superstitious, idolatrous, and Samaritane wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers.

This is a certaine rule: The author of a worship, is in a manner the performer of a worship. But Gods spirit is no author of a superstitious, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship. No, mans braine and sathan are the authors; and therefore he owes their inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no such seruice, as to attend vpon them, and to helpe them in the performance of such a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Father requireth.]</hi> Here is the first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, prouing the former assertion, drawne from the will of God. He stands vpon it to haue such kinde of worshippers; delights onely in such worship, acknowledges, and rewards onely such worship. They that would doe seruice, must doe pleasing seruice: onely this seruice pleases him; and therefore onely such seruice to be performed. A strong argument: As if I should say to one that seekes a seruice in such an house; The Master of this house requires paines, fidelity, dexterity in his seruants, and therefore such as will serue him, must be so qualified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To make euery man looke to his heart, that it be spirituall, renewed, sincere in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, for God lookes most to this. In doing a peece of worke, the Artificer labours to giue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his eye, for whom he doth it. Now Gods eye in Prayer, will examine the inward man. If God did stand vpon thy phrase of speech, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of thy body, or the like; then thou mightest make these things thy speciall care. In all seruices among men, we ayme specially to please them we serue: So should it be in Gods seruice; and yet at this day, in nothing is God displeased more. But why takest thou such a deale of paines to displease him? Thou mayest displease him, in not seruing him. Displeasing seruice is a double dishonour,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:199:159"/> because thou displeasest him in that act, wherein he specially lookes to be pleased.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Comfort to those that worship God in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and truth. Though the false brethren, in the Church, cast them out with scorne; as though their worship were not glorious enough, and therefore cry, <hi>let God be glorified,</hi> with a more stately, and magnificent kinde of worship, <hi>Is.</hi> 66.5. yet God applaudes them; he smels a sweet sauour, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers by the fire of his spirit; and turnes their burnt offering into ashes: for so it followes in that place of <hi>Isaiah; But he shall appeare to your ioy:</hi> Or as <hi>Tremellius, We shall see your ioy;</hi> namely, which ye haue in your spirituall worship of God, as a testimony of Gods approbation; <hi>when they shall be ashamed. Prou.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked, is an abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, is acceptable vnto him.</hi> A sacrifice is set out with great pompe, and furnished with variety of many glorious ceremonies. And yet the poore naked Prayer of a spirituall worship, is better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, then the sumptuous brauery of the most glorious sacrifice of the formall worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The <hi>Publicans</hi> one short eiaculated sentence, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a sinner,</hi> is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then the most flourishing Pharisaicall rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique. It is no matter what men require in Gods worship; they may require this, and that; but God requires spirit, and truth: Bring this, and we shall please him.</p>
                  <p>VERSE 24. <hi>God is a spirit, &amp;c.]</hi> A second reason, drawne from the nature of God. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:199:160"/> is a pure, spirituall Essence: His worship therefore must be answerable. <hi>A spirit;</hi> namely, vncreated, and vncompounded, most simple: for Angels are created, and compounded, and so are but drossie, and foeculent to God, who is most simple, voyde of all composition, though neuer so subtill, or refyned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Against Imagery. God is so simple, so spirituall that no Angels pensill can set out his nature. <hi>Whereunto will ye liken me?</hi> Images are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull to his simplicitie, and spirituality, as I may say, of Essence, as also to his incircumscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble infinitenesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Against all fleshly, formall, hypocriticall worship. These kindes of worshippers deny his spirituall nature: make him a God of flesh, and bone. It is common with men, in their trouble, to goe to God, but yet with some outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as this woman, in this perplexitie Christ had now cast her into, no doubt was ready to haue done, to haue runne to Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> and there haue performed some rites: such men show, they haue too too grose conceits of God: But we must learne to proportion our worship to Gods nature. Gods nature is simple; in that which is simple, there is no composition, nor diuision: Therefore in our worship there must be no composition; it must be voide of mixture: A linsey-wolsey patcht worship, sauced, spiced, sophysticated with humane inuentions, doth nothing sort with the spirituall simplicity of the diuine Essenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:199:160"/> not an heart, and an heart. As God is one without diuision; so our worship must be whole and entyre, heart and head, vnderstanding and affection, body and soule, must harmoniously conspire together, in an heauenly consort. God is a reasonable, and an vnderstanding God; and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. he must haue <hi>reasonable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</hi> Bodily seruice is but an vnreasonable seruice, which euen fooles, voide of reason, may performe. The Latine seruice of the Papists, is also an vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable seruice, for the vnderstanding is idle in that seruice. Where there is this grose hypocrisie, to giue onely a knee, a knocke on the brest, a few words, there God is not apprehended to be a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for then we would thinke he could see our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and their behauiour.</p>

                  <p>No sooner are there good desires in the godly after Christ, but the desired Christ is at hand, and shewes his face. Thus much appeares by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ioy they feele in desiring. As it is thus in this life for the spirituall presence, so also for his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall presence, and comming in person to the last Iudgement. The desires that Gods children feele in themselues, sighing for him, to make an end of all these confusions and disorders here below, are an euident argument that that comming hastens apace.</p>

                  <p>Here is the first Consequent; the Disciples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and finding him talking with this woman, with their maruell thereat: which maruell is set forth by the <hi>Diuerse,</hi> that though they maruelled in their mindes, yet they murmured not with their mouthes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As touching the maruell, the reason of it was this, because it was not Christs vsuall manner to be alone with women talking. Their maruell shewes so much.</p>

Let worldlings that haue no other treasure then earthly, let them minde and follow these earthly things, let them attend their water-pots: we with Christ doe walke vpon the waues of the Sea, and trample all these inferiour things vnder our feet, in comparison of the heauenly. After the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. the shepheards left their flockes. Alas, now we cannot leaue our beds, our sports, to come to the house of God. Gods kingdome must attend and wait vpon our pitchers: Euen on the Sabbath Seruants must be sent about meaner matters then water-pots, when they should be at the fountaine of liuing water, with their pitchers to draw, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with their eares to attend Gods word, <hi>Is.</hi> 55.1.3. But men choose rather to vse the pitcher of their owne concupiscence, to draw out of the pudly fountaine of vaine pleasures.

                  <p>Her argument whereby shee perswades them to come see this man, as in all likelihood the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> is, because hee had told her all that euer shee had done.

                  <p>Marke in the Disciples the disposition of carnall men, whose mindes are wholly taken vp with earthly matters, with eating and drinking, &amp;c.

This makes against the imputation of melancholly, cast vpon Christianity. <hi>A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a continuall feast, Prou.</hi> 15.

Againe, many are discouraged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause godlinesse is no better regarded in the world, but godlinesse is a reward to it selfe. An hungry man neede not be hyred to eate: Wee must not worke with Christ for meate, for obedience is both worke and meate. They are base workemen that will tyre here, vnlesse they may haue victuals to refresh them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 128. <hi>Thou shalt eate of thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

But the more we abound in the fruits of obedience, the stronger are we for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth further fruit. In earthly meates our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes are soone cloyed, but here obedience is both meate, and sauce too: The more we eate of this meate, the sharper is our appetite to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In regard of daily and familiar vse: It is so vncouth to many, that it may seeme physicke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then foode. A mans stomacke will looke for his foode; in most, thrice a day, breakefast, din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, supper: And to breake custome, often causes sicknesse. So Gods children should so daily inure themselues to Gods seruice; as <hi>Daniel</hi> to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thrice a day, that in the intermission, they should feele faintnesse, as in the want of foode. A man cannot long forbeare his meate, what euer his businesse be; and yet the slightest occasion makes vs neglect Gods seruice. Manies obedience, is like a niggards feast: At Easter, or some such time, many will be very deuout, but all the yeare besides, alas, but poore doings.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In regard of our furnishing, and prouiding of it. <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the yeares of plenty, prouided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst famine; and so men that goe to sea, prouide for their iourney. So must we hoord vp in the treasury of good workes, that we may haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:199:167"/> to sustaine our selues in the euill day. As Gods statutes must be our songs, our musicke. <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.54. So likewise our meate, and our viands in this our pilgrimage.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As the belly in eating hath no eares, but then we minde our meate. So in obedience (as <hi>Gehezi</hi> in his iourney) wee must haue no eares to heare Sathan, the flesh, or any allurement, specially in hearing of the word, when our soule is feeding it selfe, should there be no eares for Sathan.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When wee haue a stomacke, specially if weake, we will eate, least staying longer wee loose our stomacke: So should it be with vs, when we haue a minde to doe good.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We waite not being hungry, till meate be put into our mouthes, but wee seeke it out. So seeke out occasions of doing good, of giuing almes, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To quicken our obedience, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.14.

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Against idle, carelesse, and tith-monging Ministers, inuited onely by the hope of corruptible

Miserable are these times wherein men, otherwise free enough from contempt, are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned because Ministers. The very weed of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is enough to procure contempt. This disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Ministry threatens the departure.

As happily here to this end, this might be specified, to aggrauate the infidelitie of the Iewes, that though Christ had now done another and a second mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet but the Ruler and his houshold beleeued. Two miracles wrought, and but one houshold conuerted. God keeps an account, as of how many men are wonne by a Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. so of how many Sermons are lost by men. Where much is giuen, much is required: If Christs double paines in <hi>Cana,</hi> be not answered with their double care and obedience, his double paines in working, will but increase their double paines in suffering.</p>
